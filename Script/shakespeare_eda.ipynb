    "# Shakespeare Genre Analysis: TF-IDF, Pearson Correlation, Syntactic Complexity\n",
    "**IDS 570: Text as Data - Data Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "To what extent do Shakespeare's genre categories (tragedy, comedy, history) correspond to measurable linguistic patterns in vocabulary, similarity structure, and syntactic complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "This corpus consists of **21 Shakespeare plays** from the Folger Digital Texts edition:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tragedies (8)**  \n",
    "Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comedies (8)**  \n",
    "A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, As You Like It, The Merchant of Venice, The Taming of the Shrew, The Comedy of Errors, The Tempest\n",
    "\n",
    "**Histories (5)**  \n",
    "Henry V, Richard III, Henry IV Part 1, Henry IV Part 2, Richard II\n",
    "\n",
    "*All texts are drawn from the same editorial source to ensure consistency in formatting and transcription.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis employs three complementary quantitative approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TF–IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)**  \n",
    "   Identifies lexically distinctive terms within each play relative to the full corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pearson Correlation**  \n",
    "   Measures pairwise similarity between plays based on shared vocabulary patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Syntactic Complexity Analysis**  \n",
    "   Compares structural features (sentence length, clause density, subordination, coordination, and complex nominals) between selected plays using dependency parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analytical Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than assuming genre categories reflect inherent linguistic structure, this project evaluates whether quantitative textual evidence supports, complicates, or challenges traditional genre classifications. This exploratory approach treats genre as a hypothesis to be tested rather than a given."

Stand and unfold yourself.\n\nBARNARDO  Long live the King!\n\nFRANCISCO  Barnardo?\n\nBARNARDO  He.\n\nFRANCISCO\nYou come most carefully upon your hour.\n\nBARNARDO\n'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.\n\nFRANCISCO\nFor this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,\nAnd I am sick at heart.\n\nBARNARDO  Have you had quiet guard?\n\nFRANCISCO  Not a mouse stirring.\n\nBARNARDO  Well, good night.\nIf you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,\nThe rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.\n\n[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]\n\n\nFRANCISCO\nI think I hear them.--Stand ho! Who is there?\n\nHORATIO  Friends to this ground.\n\nMARCELLUS  And liegemen to the Dane.\n\nFRANCISCO  Give you good night.\n\nMARCELLUS\nO farewell, honest soldier. Who hath relieved\nyou?\n\nFRANCISCO\nBarnardo hath my place. Give you good night.\n[Francisco exits.]\n\nMARCELLUS  Holla, Barnardo.\n\nBARNARDO  Say, what, is Horatio there?\n\nHORATIO  A piece of him.\n\nBARNARDO\nWelcome, Horatio.--Welcome, good Marcellus.\n\nHORATIO\nWhat, has this thing appeared again tonight?\n\nBARNARDO  I have seen nothing.\n\nMARCELLUS\nHoratio says 'tis but our fantasy\nAnd will not let belief take hold of him\nTouching this dreaded sight twice seen of us.\nTherefore I have entreated him along\nWith us to watch the minutes of this night,\nThat, if again this apparition come,\nHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.\n\nHORATIO\nTush, tush, 'twill not appear.\n\nBARNARDO  Sit down awhile,\nAnd let us once again assail your ears,\nThat are so fortified against our story,\nWhat we have two nights seen.\n\nHORATIO  Well, sit we down,\nAnd let us hear Barnardo speak of this.\n\nBARNARDO  Last night of all,\nWhen yond same star that's westward from the pole\nHad made his course t' illume that part of heaven\nWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,\nThe bell then beating one--\n\n[Enter Ghost.]\n\n\nMARCELLUS\nPeace, break thee off! Look where it comes again.\n\nBARNARDO\nIn the same figure like the King that's dead.\n\nMARCELLUS, [to Horatio]\nThou art a scholar. Speak to it, Horatio.\n\nBARNARDO\nLooks he not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO\nMost like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.\n\nBARNARDO\nIt would be spoke to.\n\nMARCELLUS  Speak to it, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO\nWhat art thou that usurp'st this time of night,\nTogether with that fair and warlike form\nIn which the majesty of buried Denmark\nDid sometimes march? By heaven, I charge thee,\nspeak.\n\nMARCELLUS\nIt is offended.\n\nBARNARDO  See, it stalks away.\n\nHORATIO\nStay! speak! speak! I charge thee, speak!\n[Ghost exits.]\n\nMARCELLUS  'Tis gone and will not answer.\n\nBARNARDO\nHow now, Horatio, you tremble and look pale.\nIs not this something more than fantasy?\nWhat think you on 't?\n\nHORATIO\nBefore my God, I might not this believe\nWithout the sensible and true avouch\nOf mine own eyes.\n\nMARCELLUS  Is it not like the King?\n\nHORATIO  As thou art to thyself.\nSuch was the very armor he had on\nWhen he the ambitious Norway combated.\nSo frowned he once when, in an angry parle,\nHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.\n'Tis strange.\n\nMARCELLUS\nThus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,\nWith martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.\n\nHORATIO\nIn what particular thought to work I know not,\nBut in the gross and scope of mine opinion\nThis bodes some strange eruption to our state.\n\nMARCELLUS\nGood now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,\nWhy this same strict and most observant watch\nSo nightly toils the subject of the land,\nAnd why such daily cast of brazen cannon\nAnd foreign mart for implements of war,\nWhy such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task\nDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.\nWhat might be toward that this sweaty haste\nDoth make the night joint laborer with the day?\nWho is 't that can inform me?\n\nHORATIO  That can I.\nAt least the whisper goes so: our last king,\nWhose image even but now appeared to us,\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\nThereto pricked on by a most emulate pride,\nDared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet\n(For so this side of our known world esteemed him)\nDid slay this Fortinbras, who by a sealed compact,\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seized of, to the conqueror.\nAgainst the which a moiety competent\nWas gaged by our king, which had returned\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras\nHad he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart\nAnd carriage of the article designed,\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\nOf unimproved mettle hot and full,\nHath in the skirts of Norway here and there\nSharked up a list of lawless resolutes\nFor food and diet to some enterprise\nThat hath a stomach in 't; which is no other\n(As it doth well appear unto our state)\nBut to recover of us, by strong hand\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head\nOf this posthaste and rummage in the land.\n\nBARNARDO\nI think it be no other but e'en so.\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\nComes armed through our watch so like the king\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\n\nHORATIO\nA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\nThe graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star,\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.\nAnd even the like precurse of feared events,\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and Earth together demonstrated\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.\n\n[Enter Ghost.]\n\nBut soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!\nI'll cross it though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!\n[It spreads his arms.]\nIf thou hast any sound or use of voice,\nSpeak to me.\nIf there be any good thing to be done\nThat may to thee do ease and grace to me,\nSpeak to me.\nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate,\nWhich happily foreknowing may avoid,\nO, speak!\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\nSpeak of it.\t[The cock crows.]\nStay and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus.\n\nMARCELLUS\nShall I strike it with my partisan?\n\nHORATIO  Do, if it will not stand.\n\nBARNARDO  'Tis here.\n\nHORATIO  'Tis here.\n[Ghost exits.]\n\nMARCELLUS  'Tis gone.\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\nTo offer it the show of violence,\nFor it is as the air, invulnerable,\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\n\nBARNARDO\nIt was about to speak when the cock crew.\n\nHORATIO\nAnd then it started like a guilty thing\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\nAwake the god of day, and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\nTh' extravagant and erring spirit hies\nTo his confine, and of the truth herein\nThis present object made probation.\n\nMARCELLUS\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever 'gainst that season comes\nWherein our Savior's birth is celebrated,\nThis bird of dawning singeth all night long;\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,\nThe nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,\nSo hallowed and so gracious is that time.\n\nHORATIO\nSo have I heard and do in part believe it.\nBut look, the morn in russet mantle clad\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up, and by my advice\nLet us impart what we have seen tonight\nUnto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\n\nMARCELLUS\nLet's do 't, I pray, and I this morning know\nWhere we shall find him most convenient.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the\nQueen, the Council, as Polonius, and his son Laertes,\nHamlet, with others, among them Voltemand and\nCornelius.]\n\n\nKING\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe,\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\nTh' imperial jointress to this warlike state,\nHave we (as 'twere with a defeated joy,\nWith an auspicious and a dropping eye,\nWith mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole)\nTaken to wife. Nor have we herein barred\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\nWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.\nNow follows that you know. Young Fortinbras,\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth\nOr thinking by our late dear brother's death\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\nHe hath not failed to pester us with message\nImporting the surrender of those lands\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\nTo our most valiant brother--so much for him.\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting.\nThus much the business is: we have here writ\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,\nWho, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears\nOf this his nephew's purpose, to suppress\nHis further gait herein, in that the levies,\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\nOut of his subject; and we here dispatch\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway,\nGiving to you no further personal power\nTo business with the King more than the scope\nOf these dilated articles allow.\n[Giving them a paper.]\nFarewell, and let your haste commend your duty.\n\nCORNELIUS/VOLTEMAND\nIn that and all things will we show our duty.\n\nKING\nWe doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.\n[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]\nAnd now, Laertes, what's the news with you?\nYou told us of some suit. What is 't, Laertes?\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane\nAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg,\nLaertes,\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\n\nLAERTES  My dread lord,\nYour leave and favor to return to France,\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark\nTo show my duty in your coronation,\nYet now I must confess, that duty done,\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\n\nKING\nHave you your father's leave? What says Polonius?\n\nPOLONIUS\nHath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\nBy laborsome petition, and at last\nUpon his will I sealed my hard consent.\nI do beseech you give him leave to go.\n\nKING\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will.--\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet and my son--\n\nHAMLET, [aside]\nA little more than kin and less than kind.\n\nKING\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\n\nHAMLET\nNot so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.\n\nQUEEN\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\nDo not forever with thy vailed lids\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust.\nThou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,\nPassing through nature to eternity.\n\nHAMLET\nAy, madam, it is common.\n\nQUEEN  If it be,\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\n\nHAMLET\n\"Seems,\" madam? Nay, it is. I know not \"seems.\"\n'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\nNor windy suspiration of forced breath,\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\nNor the dejected havior of the visage,\nTogether with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed \"seem,\"\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\nBut I have that within which passes show,\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\n\nKING\n'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,\nHamlet,\nTo give these mourning duties to your father.\nBut you must know your father lost a father,\nThat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\nIn filial obligation for some term\nTo do obsequious sorrow. But to persever\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\nOf impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief.\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\nAn understanding simple and unschooled.\nFor what we know must be and is as common\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\nWhy should we in our peevish opposition\nTake it to heart? Fie, 'tis a fault to heaven,\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\nTo reason most absurd, whose common theme\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\nFrom the first corse till he that died today,\n\"This must be so.\" We pray you, throw to earth\nThis unprevailing woe and think of us\nAs of a father; for let the world take note,\nYou are the most immediate to our throne,\nAnd with no less nobility of love\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\nIt is most retrograde to our desire,\nAnd we beseech you, bend you to remain\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\n\nQUEEN\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.\nI pray thee, stay with us. Go not to Wittenberg.\n\nHAMLET\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\n\nKING\nWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.\nBe as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come.\nThis gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet\nSits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks today\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\nAnd the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\nRespeaking earthly thunder. Come away.\n[Flourish. All but Hamlet exit.]\n\nHAMLET\nO, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt,\nThaw, and resolve itself into a dew,\nOr that the Everlasting had not fixed\nHis canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,\nHow weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\nSeem to me all the uses of this world!\nFie on 't, ah fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden\nThat grows to seed. Things rank and gross in nature\nPossess it merely. That it should come to this:\nBut two months dead--nay, not so much, not two.\nSo excellent a king, that was to this\nHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother\nThat he might not beteem the winds of heaven\nVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and Earth,\nMust I remember? Why, she would hang on him\nAs if increase of appetite had grown\nBy what it fed on. And yet, within a month\n(Let me not think on 't; frailty, thy name is woman!),\nA little month, or ere those shoes were old\nWith which she followed my poor father's body,\nLike Niobe, all tears--why she, even she\n(O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason\nWould have mourned longer!), married with my\nuncle,\nMy father's brother, but no more like my father\nThan I to Hercules. Within a month,\nEre yet the salt of most unrighteous tears\nHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,\nShe married. O, most wicked speed, to post\nWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!\nIt is not, nor it cannot come to good.\nBut break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.\n\n[Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.]\n\n\nHORATIO  Hail to your Lordship.\n\nHAMLET  I am glad to see you well.\nHoratio--or I do forget myself!\n\nHORATIO\nThe same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.\n\nHAMLET\nSir, my good friend. I'll change that name with you.\nAnd what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--\nMarcellus?\n\nMARCELLUS  My good lord.\n\nHAMLET\nI am very glad to see you. [To Barnardo.] Good\neven, sir.--\nBut what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\n\nHORATIO\nA truant disposition, good my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nI would not hear your enemy say so,\nNor shall you do my ear that violence\nTo make it truster of your own report\nAgainst yourself. I know you are no truant.\nBut what is your affair in Elsinore?\nWe'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\n\nHORATIO\nMy lord, I came to see your father's funeral.\n\nHAMLET\nI prithee, do not mock me, fellow student.\nI think it was to see my mother's wedding.\n\nHORATIO\nIndeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.\n\nHAMLET\nThrift, thrift, Horatio. The funeral baked meats\nDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\nWould I had met my dearest foe in heaven\nOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio!\nMy father--methinks I see my father.\n\nHORATIO\nWhere, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  In my mind's eye, Horatio.\n\nHORATIO\nI saw him once. He was a goodly king.\n\nHAMLET\nHe was a man. Take him for all in all,\nI shall not look upon his like again.\n\nHORATIO\nMy lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\n\nHAMLET  Saw who?\n\nHORATIO\nMy lord, the King your father.\n\nHAMLET  The King my father?\n\nHORATIO\nSeason your admiration for a while\nWith an attent ear, till I may deliver\nUpon the witness of these gentlemen\nThis marvel to you.\n\nHAMLET  For God's love, let me hear!\n\nHORATIO\nTwo nights together had these gentlemen,\nMarcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,\nIn the dead waste and middle of the night,\nBeen thus encountered: a figure like your father,\nArmed at point exactly, cap-a-pie,\nAppears before them and with solemn march\nGoes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walked\nBy their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes\nWithin his truncheon's length, whilst they, distilled\nAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,\nStand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\nIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,\nAnd I with them the third night kept the watch,\nWhere, as they had delivered, both in time,\nForm of the thing (each word made true and good),\nThe apparition comes. I knew your father;\nThese hands are not more like.\n\nHAMLET  But where was this?\n\nMARCELLUS\nMy lord, upon the platform where we watch.\n\nHAMLET\nDid you not speak to it?\n\nHORATIO  My lord, I did,\nBut answer made it none. Yet once methought\nIt lifted up its head and did address\nItself to motion, like as it would speak;\nBut even then the morning cock crew loud,\nAnd at the sound it shrunk in haste away\nAnd vanished from our sight.\n\nHAMLET  'Tis very strange.\n\nHORATIO\nAs I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true.\nAnd we did think it writ down in our duty\nTo let you know of it.\n\nHAMLET  Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.\nHold you the watch tonight?\n\nALL  We do, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nArmed, say you?\n\nALL  Armed, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  From top to toe?\n\nALL  My lord, from head to foot.\n\nHAMLET  Then saw you not his face?\n\nHORATIO\nO, yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.\n\nHAMLET  What, looked he frowningly?\n\nHORATIO\nA countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\n\nHAMLET  Pale or red?\n\nHORATIO\nNay, very pale.\n\nHAMLET  And fixed his eyes upon you?\n\nHORATIO\nMost constantly.\n\nHAMLET  I would I had been there.\n\nHORATIO  It would have much amazed you.\n\nHAMLET  Very like. Stayed it long?\n\nHORATIO\nWhile one with moderate haste might tell a\nhundred.\n\nBARNARDO/MARCELLUS  Longer, longer.\n\nHORATIO\nNot when I saw 't.\n\nHAMLET  His beard was grizzled, no?\n\nHORATIO\nIt was as I have seen it in his life,\nA sable silvered.\n\nHAMLET  I will watch tonight.\nPerchance 'twill walk again.\n\nHORATIO  I warrant it will.\n\nHAMLET\nIf it assume my noble father's person,\nI'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\nAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\nIf you have hitherto concealed this sight,\nLet it be tenable in your silence still;\nAnd whatsomever else shall hap tonight,\nGive it an understanding but no tongue.\nI will requite your loves. So fare you well.\nUpon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,\nI'll visit you.\n\nALL  Our duty to your Honor.\n\nHAMLET\nYour loves, as mine to you. Farewell.\n[All but Hamlet exit.]\nMy father's spirit--in arms! All is not well.\nI doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!\nTill then, sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,\nThough all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's\neyes.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Laertes and Ophelia, his sister.]\n\n\nLAERTES\nMy necessaries are embarked. Farewell.\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\nAnd convey is assistant, do not sleep,\nBut let me hear from you.\n\nOPHELIA  Do you doubt that?\n\nLAERTES\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood,\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute,\nNo more.\n\nOPHELIA  No more but so?\n\nLAERTES  Think it no more.\nFor nature, crescent, does not grow alone\nIn thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\nHis greatness weighed, his will is not his own,\nFor he himself is subject to his birth.\nHe may not, as unvalued persons do,\nCarve for himself, for on his choice depends\nThe safety and the health of this whole state.\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscribed\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then, if he says he loves\nyou,\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\nAs he in his particular act and place\nMay give his saying deed, which is no further\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honor may sustain\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs\nOr lose your heart or your chaste treasure open\nTo his unmastered importunity.\nFear it, Ophelia; fear it, my dear sister,\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\nVirtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes.\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\nToo oft before their buttons be disclosed,\nAnd, in the morn and liquid dew of youth,\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\nBe wary, then; best safety lies in fear.\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\n\nOPHELIA\nI shall the effect of this good lesson keep\nAs watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,\nDo not, as some ungracious pastors do,\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven,\nWhiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine,\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads\nAnd recks not his own rede.\n\nLAERTES  O, fear me not.\n\n[Enter Polonius.]\n\nI stay too long. But here my father comes.\nA double blessing is a double grace.\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\n\nPOLONIUS\nYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\nAnd you are stayed for. There, my blessing with\nthee.\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\nNor any unproportioned thought his act.\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\nOf each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware\nOf entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\nBear 't that th' opposed may beware of thee.\nGive every man thy ear, but few thy voice.\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\nBut not expressed in fancy (rich, not gaudy),\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man,\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be,\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend,\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\nThis above all: to thine own self be true,\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nFarewell. My blessing season this in thee.\n\nLAERTES\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\n\nPOLONIUS\nThe time invests you. Go, your servants tend.\n\nLAERTES\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\nWhat I have said to you.\n\nOPHELIA  'Tis in my memory locked,\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\n\nLAERTES  Farewell.\t[Laertes exits.]\n\nPOLONIUS\nWhat is 't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\n\nOPHELIA\nSo please you, something touching the Lord\nHamlet.\n\nPOLONIUS  Marry, well bethought.\n'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\nGiven private time to you, and you yourself\nHave of your audience been most free and\nbounteous.\nIf it be so (as so 'tis put on me,\nAnd that in way of caution), I must tell you\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\nAs it behooves my daughter and your honor.\nWhat is between you? Give me up the truth.\n\nOPHELIA\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\nOf his affection to me.\n\nPOLONIUS\nAffection, puh! You speak like a green girl\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\nDo you believe his \"tenders,\" as you call them?\n\nOPHELIA\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\n\nPOLONIUS\nMarry, I will teach you. Think yourself a baby\nThat you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,\nOr (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\nRunning it thus) you'll tender me a fool.\n\nOPHELIA\nMy lord, he hath importuned me with love\nIn honorable fashion--\n\nPOLONIUS\nAy, \"fashion\" you may call it. Go to, go to!\n\nOPHELIA\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\n\nPOLONIUS\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both\nEven in their promise as it is a-making,\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence.\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\nThan a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve so much in him that he is young,\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows, for they are brokers,\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\nLook to 't, I charge you. Come your ways.\n\nOPHELIA  I shall obey, my lord.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]\n\n\nHAMLET\nThe air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.\n\nHORATIO\nIt is a nipping and an eager air.\n\nHAMLET  What hour now?\n\nHORATIO  I think it lacks of twelve.\n\nMARCELLUS  No, it is struck.\n\nHORATIO\nIndeed, I heard it not. It then draws near the season\nWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.\n[A flourish of trumpets and two pieces goes off.]\nWhat does this mean, my lord?\n\nHAMLET\nThe King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,\nKeeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels;\nAnd, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,\nThe kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out\nThe triumph of his pledge.\n\nHORATIO  Is it a custom?\n\nHAMLET  Ay, marry, is 't,\nBut, to my mind, though I am native here\nAnd to the manner born, it is a custom\nMore honored in the breach than the observance.\nThis heavy-headed revel east and west\nMakes us traduced and taxed of other nations.\nThey clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase\nSoil our addition. And, indeed, it takes\nFrom our achievements, though performed at\nheight,\nThe pith and marrow of our attribute.\nSo oft it chances in particular men\nThat for some vicious mole of nature in them,\nAs in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,\nSince nature cannot choose his origin),\nBy the o'ergrowth of some complexion\n(Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason),\nOr by some habit that too much o'erleavens\nThe form of plausive manners--that these men,\nCarrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,\nBeing nature's livery or fortune's star,\nHis virtues else, be they as pure as grace,\nAs infinite as man may undergo,\nShall in the general censure take corruption\nFrom that particular fault. The dram of evil\nDoth all the noble substance of a doubt\nTo his own scandal.\n\n[Enter Ghost.]\n\n\nHORATIO  Look, my lord, it comes.\n\nHAMLET\nAngels and ministers of grace, defend us!\nBe thou a spirit of health or goblin damned,\nBring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from\nhell,\nBe thy intents wicked or charitable,\nThou com'st in such a questionable shape\nThat I will speak to thee. I'll call thee \"Hamlet,\"\n\"King,\" \"Father,\" \"Royal Dane.\" O, answer me!\nLet me not burst in ignorance, but tell\nWhy thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,\nHave burst their cerements; why the sepulcher,\nWherein we saw thee quietly interred,\nHath oped his ponderous and marble jaws\nTo cast thee up again. What may this mean\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,\nRevisits thus the glimpses of the moon,\nMaking night hideous, and we fools of nature\nSo horridly to shake our disposition\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\nSay, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?\n[Ghost beckons.]\n\nHORATIO\nIt beckons you to go away with it\nAs if it some impartment did desire\nTo you alone.\n\nMARCELLUS  Look with what courteous action\nIt waves you to a more removed ground.\nBut do not go with it.\n\nHORATIO  No, by no means.\n\nHAMLET\nIt will not speak. Then I will follow it.\n\nHORATIO\nDo not, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Why, what should be the fear?\nI do not set my life at a pin's fee.\nAnd for my soul, what can it do to that,\nBeing a thing immortal as itself?\nIt waves me forth again. I'll follow it.\n\nHORATIO\nWhat if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord?\nOr to the dreadful summit of the cliff\nThat beetles o'er his base into the sea,\nAnd there assume some other horrible form\nWhich might deprive your sovereignty of reason\nAnd draw you into madness? Think of it.\nThe very place puts toys of desperation,\nWithout more motive, into every brain\nThat looks so many fathoms to the sea\nAnd hears it roar beneath.\n\nHAMLET\nIt waves me still.--Go on, I'll follow thee.\n\nMARCELLUS\nYou shall not go, my lord.\t[They hold back Hamlet.]\n\nHAMLET  Hold off your hands.\n\nHORATIO\nBe ruled. You shall not go.\n\nHAMLET  My fate cries out\nAnd makes each petty arture in this body\nAs hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.\nStill am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen.\nBy heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!\nI say, away!--Go on. I'll follow thee.\n[Ghost and Hamlet exit.]\n\nHORATIO\nHe waxes desperate with imagination.\n\nMARCELLUS\nLet's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.\n\nHORATIO\nHave after. To what issue will this come?\n\nMARCELLUS\nSomething is rotten in the state of Denmark.\n\nHORATIO\nHeaven will direct it.\n\nMARCELLUS  Nay, let's follow him.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n[Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]\n\n\nHAMLET\nWhither wilt thou lead me? Speak. I'll go no\nfurther.\n\nGHOST\nMark me.\n\nHAMLET  I will.\n\nGHOST  My hour is almost come\nWhen I to sulf'rous and tormenting flames\nMust render up myself.\n\nHAMLET  Alas, poor ghost!\n\nGHOST\nPity me not, but lend thy serious hearing\nTo what I shall unfold.\n\nHAMLET  Speak. I am bound to hear.\n\nGHOST\nSo art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.\n\nHAMLET  What?\n\nGHOST  I am thy father's spirit,\nDoomed for a certain term to walk the night\nAnd for the day confined to fast in fires\nTill the foul crimes done in my days of nature\nAre burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid\nTo tell the secrets of my prison house,\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\nWould harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,\nMake thy two eyes, like stars, start from their\nspheres,\nThy knotted and combined locks to part,\nAnd each particular hair to stand an end,\nLike quills upon the fearful porpentine.\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\nTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O list!\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love--\n\nHAMLET  O God!\n\nGHOST\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\n\nHAMLET  Murder?\n\nGHOST\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is,\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\n\nHAMLET\nHaste me to know 't, that I, with wings as swift\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love,\nMay sweep to my revenge.\n\nGHOST  I find thee apt;\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\nThat roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\n'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\nA serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark\nIs by a forged process of my death\nRankly abused. But know, thou noble youth,\nThe serpent that did sting thy father's life\nNow wears his crown.\n\nHAMLET  O, my prophetic soul! My uncle!\n\nGHOST\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\nWith witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts--\nO wicked wit and gifts, that have the power\nSo to seduce!--won to his shameful lust\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there!\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\nI made to her in marriage, and to decline\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\nTo those of mine.\nBut virtue, as it never will be moved,\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,\nSo, lust, though to a radiant angel linked,\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\nAnd prey on garbage.\nBut soft, methinks I scent the morning air.\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\nWith juice of cursed hebona in a vial\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\nThe leprous distilment, whose effect\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body,\nAnd with a sudden vigor it doth posset\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,\nAnd a most instant tetter barked about,\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\nAll my smooth body.\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched,\nCut off, even in the blossoms of my sin,\nUnhouseled, disappointed, unaneled,\nNo reck'ning made, but sent to my account\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\nO horrible, O horrible, most horrible!\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\nBut, howsomever thou pursues this act,\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\nAgainst thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.\nThe glowworm shows the matin to be near\nAnd 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\nAdieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.\t[He exits.]\n\nHAMLET\nO all you host of heaven! O Earth! What else?\nAnd shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my heart,\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?\nAy, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?\nYea, from the table of my memory\nI'll wipe away all trivial, fond records,\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\nThat youth and observation copied there,\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\nUnmixed with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!\nO most pernicious woman!\nO villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!\nMy tables--meet it is I set it down\nThat one may smile and smile and be a villain.\nAt least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.\n[He writes.]\nSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word.\nIt is \"adieu, adieu, remember me.\"\nI have sworn 't.\n\n[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]\n\n\nHORATIO  My lord, my lord!\n\nMARCELLUS  Lord Hamlet.\n\nHORATIO  Heavens secure him!\n\nHAMLET  So be it.\n\nMARCELLUS  Illo, ho, ho, my lord!\n\nHAMLET  Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come!\n\nMARCELLUS\nHow is 't, my noble lord?\n\nHORATIO  What news, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  O, wonderful!\n\nHORATIO\nGood my lord, tell it.\n\nHAMLET  No, you will reveal it.\n\nHORATIO\nNot I, my lord, by heaven.\n\nMARCELLUS  Nor I, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nHow say you, then? Would heart of man once think\nit?\nBut you'll be secret?\n\nHORATIO/MARCELLUS   Ay, by heaven, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nThere's never a villain dwelling in all Denmark\nBut he's an arrant knave.\n\nHORATIO\nThere needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave\nTo tell us this.\n\nHAMLET  Why, right, you are in the right.\nAnd so, without more circumstance at all,\nI hold it fit that we shake hands and part,\nYou, as your business and desire shall point you\n(For every man hath business and desire,\nSuch as it is), and for my own poor part,\nI will go pray.\n\nHORATIO\nThese are but wild and whirling words, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nI am sorry they offend you, heartily;\nYes, faith, heartily.\n\nHORATIO  There's no offense, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nYes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,\nAnd much offense, too. Touching this vision here,\nIt is an honest ghost--that let me tell you.\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\nO'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\nGive me one poor request.\n\nHORATIO  What is 't, my lord? We will.\n\nHAMLET\nNever make known what you have seen tonight.\n\nHORATIO/MARCELLUS   My lord, we will not.\n\nHAMLET  Nay, but swear 't.\n\nHORATIO  In faith, my lord, not I.\n\nMARCELLUS  Nor I, my lord, in faith.\n\nHAMLET\nUpon my sword.\n\nMARCELLUS  We have sworn, my lord, already.\n\nHAMLET  Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.\n\nGHOST [cries under the stage]  Swear.\n\nHAMLET\nHa, ha, boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there,\ntruepenny?\nCome on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\nConsent to swear.\n\nHORATIO  Propose the oath, my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nNever to speak of this that you have seen,\nSwear by my sword.\n\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear.\n\nHAMLET\nHic et ubique? Then we'll shift our ground.\nCome hither, gentlemen,\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword.\nSwear by my sword\nNever to speak of this that you have heard.\n\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear by his sword.\n\nHAMLET\nWell said, old mole. Canst work i' th' earth so fast?--\nA worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.\n\nHORATIO\nO day and night, but this is wondrous strange.\n\nHAMLET\nAnd therefore as a stranger give it welcome.\nThere are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\nThan are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come.\nHere, as before, never, so help you mercy,\nHow strange or odd some'er I bear myself\n(As I perchance hereafter shall think meet\nTo put an antic disposition on)\nThat you, at such times seeing me, never shall,\nWith arms encumbered thus, or this headshake,\nOr by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,\nAs \"Well, well, we know,\" or \"We could an if we\nwould,\"\nOr \"If we list to speak,\" or \"There be an if they\nmight,\"\nOr such ambiguous giving-out, to note\nThat you know aught of me--this do swear,\nSo grace and mercy at your most need help you.\n\nGHOST, [beneath]  Swear.\n\nHAMLET\nRest, rest, perturbed spirit.--So, gentlemen,\nWith all my love I do commend me to you,\nAnd what so poor a man as Hamlet is\nMay do t' express his love and friending to you,\nGod willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,\nAnd still your fingers on your lips, I pray.\nThe time is out of joint. O cursed spite\nThat ever I was born to set it right!\nNay, come, let's go together.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 2\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter old Polonius with his man Reynaldo.]\n\n\nPOLONIUS\nGive him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.\n\nREYNALDO  I will, my lord.\n\nPOLONIUS\nYou shall do marvelous wisely, good Reynaldo,\nBefore you visit him, to make inquire\nOf his behavior.\n\nREYNALDO  My lord, I did intend it.\n\nPOLONIUS\nMarry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,\nInquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;\nAnd how, and who, what means, and where they\nkeep,\nWhat company, at what expense; and finding\nBy this encompassment and drift of question\nThat they do know my son, come you more nearer\nThan your particular demands will touch it.\nTake you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him,\nAs thus: \"I know his father and his friends\nAnd, in part, him.\" Do you mark this, Reynaldo?\n\nREYNALDO  Ay, very well, my lord.\n\nPOLONIUS\n\"And, in part, him, but,\" you may say, \"not well.\nBut if 't be he I mean, he's very wild,\nAddicted so and so.\" And there put on him\nWhat forgeries you please--marry, none so rank\nAs may dishonor him, take heed of that,\nBut, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips\nAs are companions noted and most known\nTo youth and liberty.\n\nREYNALDO  As gaming, my lord.\n\nPOLONIUS  Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,\nQuarreling, drabbing--you may go so far.\n\nREYNALDO  My lord, that would dishonor him.\n\nPOLONIUS\nFaith, no, as you may season it in the charge.\nYou must not put another scandal on him\nThat he is open to incontinency;\nThat's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so\nquaintly\nThat they may seem the taints of liberty,\nThe flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,\nA savageness in unreclaimed blood,\nOf general assault.\n\nREYNALDO  But, my good lord--\n\nPOLONIUS  Wherefore should you do this?\n\nREYNALDO  Ay, my lord, I would know that.\n\nPOLONIUS  Marry, sir, here's my drift,\nAnd I believe it is a fetch of wit.\nYou, laying these slight sullies on my son,\nAs 'twere a thing a little soiled i' th' working,\nMark you, your party in converse, him you would\nsound,\nHaving ever seen in the prenominate crimes\nThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assured\nHe closes with you in this consequence:\n\"Good sir,\" or so, or \"friend,\" or \"gentleman,\"\nAccording to the phrase or the addition\nOf man and country--\n\nREYNALDO  Very good, my lord.\n\nPOLONIUS  And then, sir, does he this, he does--what\nwas I about to say? By the Mass, I was about to say\nsomething. Where did I leave?\n\nREYNALDO  At \"closes in the consequence,\" at \"friend,\nor so,\" and \"gentleman.\"\n\nPOLONIUS\nAt \"closes in the consequence\"--ay, marry--\nHe closes thus: \"I know the gentleman.\nI saw him yesterday,\" or \"th' other day\"\n(Or then, or then, with such or such), \"and as you\nsay,\nThere was he gaming, there o'ertook in 's rouse,\nThere falling out at tennis\"; or perchance\n\"I saw him enter such a house of sale\"--\nVidelicet, a brothel--or so forth.

Long stayed he so.\nAt last, a little shaking of mine arm,\nAnd thrice his head thus waving up and down,\nHe raised a sigh so piteous and profound\nAs it did seem to shatter all his bulk\nAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,\nAnd, with his head over his shoulder turned,\nHe seemed to find his way without his eyes,\nFor out o' doors he went without their helps\nAnd to the last bended their light on me.\n\nPOLONIUS\nCome, go with me. I will go seek the King.\nThis is the very ecstasy of love,\nWhose violent property fordoes itself\nAnd leads the will to desperate undertakings\nAs oft as any passions under heaven\nThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry.\nWhat, have you given him any hard words of late?\n\nOPHELIA\nNo, my good lord, but as you did command\nI did repel his letters and denied\nHis access to me.\n\nPOLONIUS  That hath made him mad.\nI am sorry that with better heed and judgment\nI had not coted him. I feared he did but trifle\nAnd meant to wrack thee. But beshrew my jealousy!\nBy heaven, it is as proper to our age\nTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinions\nAs it is common for the younger sort\nTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.\nThis must be known, which, being kept close, might\nmove\nMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.\nCome.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Flourish. Enter King and Queen, Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern and Attendants.]\n\n\nKING\nWelcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\nMoreover that we much did long to see you,\nThe need we have to use you did provoke\nOur hasty sending. Something have you heard\nOf Hamlet's transformation, so call it,\nSith nor th' exterior nor the inward man\nResembles that it was. What it should be,\nMore than his father's death, that thus hath put him\nSo much from th' understanding of himself\nI cannot dream of. I entreat you both\nThat, being of so young days brought up with him\nAnd sith so neighbored to his youth and havior,\nThat you vouchsafe your rest here in our court\nSome little time, so by your companies\nTo draw him on to pleasures, and to gather\nSo much as from occasion you may glean,\nWhether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus\nThat, opened, lies within our remedy.\n\nQUEEN\nGood gentlemen, he hath much talked of you,\nAnd sure I am two men there is not living\nTo whom he more adheres. If it will please you\nTo show us so much gentry and goodwill\nAs to expend your time with us awhile\nFor the supply and profit of our hope,\nYour visitation shall receive such thanks\nAs fits a king's remembrance.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Both your Majesties\nMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,\nPut your dread pleasures more into command\nThan to entreaty.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  But we both obey,\nAnd here give up ourselves in the full bent\nTo lay our service freely at your feet,\nTo be commanded.\n\nKING\nThanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.\n\nQUEEN\nThanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.\nAnd I beseech you instantly to visit\nMy too much changed son.--Go, some of you,\nAnd bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.\n\nGUILDENSTERN\nHeavens make our presence and our practices\nPleasant and helpful to him!\n\nQUEEN  Ay, amen!\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit\nwith some Attendants.]\n\n[Enter Polonius.]\n\n\nPOLONIUS\nTh' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,\nAre joyfully returned.\n\nKING\nThou still hast been the father of good news.\n\nPOLONIUS\nHave I, my lord? I assure my good liege\nI hold my duty as I hold my soul,\nBoth to my God and to my gracious king,\nAnd I do think, or else this brain of mine\nHunts not the trail of policy so sure\nAs it hath used to do, that I have found\nThe very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.\n\nKING\nO, speak of that! That do I long to hear.\n\nPOLONIUS\nGive first admittance to th' ambassadors.\nMy news shall be the fruit to that great feast.\n\nKING\nThyself do grace to them and bring them in.\n[Polonius exits.]\nHe tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found\nThe head and source of all your son's distemper.\n\nQUEEN\nI doubt it is no other but the main--\nHis father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.\n\nKING\nWell, we shall sift him.\n\n[Enter Ambassadors Voltemand and Cornelius with\nPolonius.]\n\nWelcome, my good friends.\nSay, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?\n\nVOLTEMAND\nMost fair return of greetings and desires.\nUpon our first, he sent out to suppress\nHis nephew's levies, which to him appeared\nTo be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,\nBut, better looked into, he truly found\nIt was against your Highness. Whereat, grieved\nThat so his sickness, age, and impotence\nWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests\nOn Fortinbras, which he, in brief, obeys,\nReceives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,\nMakes vow before his uncle never more\nTo give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.\nWhereon old Norway, overcome with joy,\nGives him three-score thousand crowns in annual\nfee\nAnd his commission to employ those soldiers,\nSo levied as before, against the Polack,\nWith an entreaty, herein further shown,\n[He gives a paper.]\nThat it might please you to give quiet pass\nThrough your dominions for this enterprise,\nOn such regards of safety and allowance\nAs therein are set down.\n\nKING  It likes us well,\nAnd, at our more considered time, we'll read,\nAnswer, and think upon this business.\nMeantime, we thank you for your well-took labor.\nGo to your rest. At night we'll feast together.\nMost welcome home!\n[Voltemand and Cornelius exit.]\n\nPOLONIUS  This business is well ended.\nMy liege, and madam, to expostulate\nWhat majesty should be, what duty is,\nWhy day is day, night night, and time is time\nWere nothing but to waste night, day, and time.\nTherefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,\nAnd tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,\nI will be brief. Your noble son is mad.\n\"Mad\" call I it, for, to define true madness,\nWhat is 't but to be nothing else but mad?\nBut let that go.\n\nQUEEN  More matter with less art.\n\nPOLONIUS\nMadam, I swear I use no art at all.\nThat he's mad, 'tis true; 'tis true 'tis pity,\nAnd pity 'tis 'tis true--a foolish figure,\nBut farewell it, for I will use no art.\nMad let us grant him then, and now remains\nThat we find out the cause of this effect,\nOr, rather say, the cause of this defect,\nFor this effect defective comes by cause.\nThus it remains, and the remainder thus.\nPerpend.\nI have a daughter (have while she is mine)\nWho, in her duty and obedience, mark,\nHath given me this. Now gather and surmise.\n[He reads.] To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the\nmost beautified Ophelia--\nThat's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; \"beautified\" is a\nvile phrase. But you shall hear. Thus: [He reads.]\nIn her excellent white bosom, these, etc.--\n\nQUEEN  Came this from Hamlet to her?\n\nPOLONIUS\nGood madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful.\n[He reads the letter.]\n\tDoubt thou the stars are fire,\n\t   Doubt that the sun doth move,\n\tDoubt truth to be a liar,\n\t   But never doubt I love.\nO dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not\nart to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, O\nmost best, believe it. Adieu.\nThine evermore, most dear lady, whilst\nthis machine is to him, Hamlet.\nThis, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,\nAnd more above, hath his solicitings,\nAs they fell out by time, by means, and place,\nAll given to mine ear.\n\nKING  But how hath she received his love?\n\nPOLONIUS  What do you think of me?\n\nKING\nAs of a man faithful and honorable.\n\nPOLONIUS\nI would fain prove so. But what might you think,\nWhen I had seen this hot love on the wing\n(As I perceived it, I must tell you that,\nBefore my daughter told me), what might you,\nOr my dear Majesty your queen here, think,\nIf I had played the desk or table-book\nOr given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,\nOr looked upon this love with idle sight?\nWhat might you think? No, I went round to work,\nAnd my young mistress thus I did bespeak:\n\"Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.\nThis must not be.\" And then I prescripts gave her,\nThat she should lock herself from his resort,\nAdmit no messengers, receive no tokens;\nWhich done, she took the fruits of my advice,\nAnd he, repelled (a short tale to make),\nFell into a sadness, then into a fast,\nThence to a watch, thence into a weakness,\nThence to a lightness, and, by this declension,\nInto the madness wherein now he raves\nAnd all we mourn for.\n\nKING, [to Queen]  Do you think 'tis this?\n\nQUEEN  It may be, very like.\n\nPOLONIUS\nHath there been such a time (I would fain know\nthat)\nThat I have positively said \"'Tis so,\"\nWhen it proved otherwise?\n\nKING  Not that I know.\n\nPOLONIUS\nTake this from this, if this be otherwise.\nIf circumstances lead me, I will find\nWhere truth is hid, though it were hid, indeed,\nWithin the center.\n\nKING  How may we try it further?\n\nPOLONIUS\nYou know sometimes he walks four hours together\nHere in the lobby.\n\nQUEEN  So he does indeed.\n\nPOLONIUS\nAt such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.\n[To the King.] Be you and I behind an arras then.\nMark the encounter. If he love her not,\nAnd be not from his reason fall'n thereon,\nLet me be no assistant for a state,\nBut keep a farm and carters.\n\nKING  We will try it.\n\n[Enter Hamlet reading on a book.]\n\n\nQUEEN\nBut look where sadly the poor wretch comes\nreading.\n\nPOLONIUS\nAway, I do beseech you both, away.\nI'll board him presently. O, give me leave.\n[King and Queen exit with Attendants.]\nHow does my good Lord Hamlet?\n\nHAMLET  Well, God-a-mercy.\n\nPOLONIUS  Do you know me, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.\n\nPOLONIUS  Not I, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Then I would you were so honest a man.\n\nPOLONIUS  Honest, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to\nbe one man picked out of ten thousand.\n\nPOLONIUS  That's very true, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  For if the sun breed maggots in a dead\ndog, being a good kissing carrion--Have you a\ndaughter?\n\nPOLONIUS  I have, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Let her not walk i' th' sun. Conception is a\nblessing, but, as your daughter may conceive,\nfriend, look to 't.\n\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on\nmy daughter. Yet he knew me not at first; he said I\nwas a fishmonger. He is far gone. And truly, in my\nyouth, I suffered much extremity for love, very near\nthis. I'll speak to him again.--What do you read, my\nlord?\n\nHAMLET  Words, words, words.\n\nPOLONIUS  What is the matter, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Between who?\n\nPOLONIUS  I mean the matter that you read, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here\nthat old men have gray beards, that their faces are\nwrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and\nplum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of\nwit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,\nthough I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I\nhold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for\nyourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,\nyou could go backward.\n\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is\nmethod in 't.--Will you walk out of the air, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Into my grave?\n\nPOLONIUS  Indeed, that's out of the air. [Aside.] How\npregnant sometimes his replies are! A happiness\nthat often madness hits on, which reason and\nsanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I\nwill leave him and suddenly contrive the means of\nmeeting between him and my daughter.--My lord,\nI will take my leave of you.\n\nHAMLET  You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I\nwill more willingly part withal--except my life,\nexcept my life, except my life.\n\nPOLONIUS  Fare you well, my lord.\n\nHAMLET, [aside]  These tedious old fools.\n\n[Enter Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.]\n\n\nPOLONIUS  You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.\n\nROSENCRANTZ, [to Polonius]  God save you, sir.\n[Polonius exits.]\n\nGUILDENSTERN  My honored lord.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  My most dear lord.\n\nHAMLET  My excellent good friends! How dost thou,\nGuildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do\nyou both?\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\n\nGUILDENSTERN\nHappy in that we are not overhappy.\nOn Fortune's cap, we are not the very button.\n\nHAMLET  Nor the soles of her shoe?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Neither, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Then you live about her waist, or in the\nmiddle of her favors?\n\nGUILDENSTERN  Faith, her privates we.\n\nHAMLET  In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true!\nShe is a strumpet. What news?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  None, my lord, but that the world's\ngrown honest.\n\nHAMLET  Then is doomsday near. But your news is not\ntrue. Let me question more in particular. What\nhave you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of\nFortune that she sends you to prison hither?\n\nGUILDENSTERN  Prison, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Denmark's a prison.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Then is the world one.\n\nHAMLET  A goodly one, in which there are many confines,\nwards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o'\nth' worst.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  We think not so, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Why, then, 'tis none to you, for there is\nnothing either good or bad but thinking makes it\nso. To me, it is a prison.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Why, then, your ambition makes it one.\n'Tis too narrow for your mind.\n\nHAMLET  O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and\ncount myself a king of infinite space, were it not\nthat I have bad dreams.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,\nfor the very substance of the ambitious is merely\nthe shadow of a dream.\n\nHAMLET  A dream itself is but a shadow.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy\nand light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.\n\nHAMLET  Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs\nand outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows.\nShall we to th' court? For, by my fay, I cannot\nreason.\n\nROSENCRANTZ/GUILDENSTERN  We'll wait upon you.\n\nHAMLET  No such matter. I will not sort you with the\nrest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an\nhonest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,\nin the beaten way of friendship, what make you at\nElsinore?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.\n\nHAMLET  Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;\nbut I thank you, and sure, dear friends, my thanks\nare too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for?\nIs it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation?\nCome, come, deal justly with me. Come, come; nay,\nspeak.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  What should we say, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Anything but to th' purpose. You were sent\nfor, and there is a kind of confession in your looks\nwhich your modesties have not craft enough to\ncolor. I know the good king and queen have sent for\nyou.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  To what end, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  That you must teach me. But let me conjure\nyou by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy\nof our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved\nlove, and by what more dear a better\nproposer can charge you withal: be even and direct\nwith me whether you were sent for or no.\n\nROSENCRANTZ, [to Guildenstern]  What say you?\n\nHAMLET, [aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If\nyou love me, hold not off.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  My lord, we were sent for.\n\nHAMLET  I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation\nprevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the\nKing and Queen molt no feather. I have of late, but\nwherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all\ncustom of exercises, and, indeed, it goes so heavily\nwith my disposition that this goodly frame, the\nEarth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this most\nexcellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging\nfirmament, this majestical roof, fretted\nwith golden fire--why, it appeareth nothing to me\nbut a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors.\nWhat a piece of work is a man, how noble in\nreason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving\nhow express and admirable; in action how like\nan angel, in apprehension how like a god: the\nbeauty of the world, the paragon of animals--and\nyet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man\ndelights not me, no, nor women neither, though by\nyour smiling you seem to say so.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  My lord, there was no such stuff in my\nthoughts.\n\nHAMLET  Why did you laugh, then, when I said \"man\ndelights not me\"?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  To think, my lord, if you delight not in\nman, what Lenten entertainment the players shall\nreceive from you. We coted them on the way, and\nhither are they coming to offer you service.\n\nHAMLET  He that plays the king shall be welcome--his\nMajesty shall have tribute on me. The adventurous\nknight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall\nnot sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his\npart in peace, the clown shall make those laugh\nwhose lungs are tickle o' th' sear, and the lady\nshall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall\nhalt for 't. What players are they?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Even those you were wont to take such\ndelight in, the tragedians of the city.\n\nHAMLET  How chances it they travel? Their residence,\nboth in reputation and profit, was better both ways.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  I think their inhibition comes by the\nmeans of the late innovation.\n\nHAMLET  Do they hold the same estimation they did\nwhen I was in the city? Are they so followed?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  No, indeed are they not.\n\nHAMLET  How comes it? Do they grow rusty?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted\npace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little\neyases, that cry out on the top of question and are\nmost tyrannically clapped for 't. These are now the\nfashion and so berattle the common stages (so\nthey call them) that many wearing rapiers are afraid\nof goose quills and dare scarce come thither.\n\nHAMLET  What, are they children? Who maintains 'em?\nHow are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality\nno longer than they can sing? Will they not say\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common\nplayers (as it is most like, if their means are\nno better), their writers do them wrong to make\nthem exclaim against their own succession?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Faith, there has been much to-do on\nboth sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tar\nthem to controversy. There was for a while no\nmoney bid for argument unless the poet and the\nplayer went to cuffs in the question.\n\nHAMLET  Is 't possible?\n\nGUILDENSTERN  O, there has been much throwing\nabout of brains.\n\nHAMLET  Do the boys carry it away?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, that they do, my lord--Hercules\nand his load too.\n\nHAMLET  It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of\nDenmark, and those that would make mouths at\nhim while my father lived give twenty, forty, fifty,\na hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.\n'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,\nif philosophy could find it out.\n[A flourish for the Players.]\n\nGUILDENSTERN  There are the players.\n\nHAMLET  Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.\nYour hands, come then. Th' appurtenance of welcome\nis fashion and ceremony. Let me comply\nwith you in this garb, lest my extent to the players,\nwhich, I tell you, must show fairly outwards, should\nmore appear like entertainment than yours. You are\nwelcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are\ndeceived.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  In what, my dear lord?\n\nHAMLET  I am but mad north-north-west. When the\nwind is southerly, I know a hawk from a handsaw.\n\n[Enter Polonius.]\n\n\nPOLONIUS  Well be with you, gentlemen.\n\nHAMLET  Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too--at\neach ear a hearer! That great baby you see there is\nnot yet out of his swaddling clouts.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Haply he is the second time come to\nthem, for they say an old man is twice a child.\n\nHAMLET  I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the\nplayers; mark it.--You say right, sir, a Monday\nmorning, 'twas then indeed.\n\nPOLONIUS  My lord, I have news to tell you.\n\nHAMLET  My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius\nwas an actor in Rome--\n\nPOLONIUS  The actors are come hither, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Buzz, buzz.\n\nPOLONIUS  Upon my honor--\n\nHAMLET  Then came each actor on his ass.\n\nPOLONIUS  The best actors in the world, either for\ntragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,\nhistorical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\ntragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or\npoem unlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor\nPlautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty,\nthese are the only men.\n\nHAMLET  O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure\nhadst thou!\n\nPOLONIUS  What a treasure had he, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Why,\n\tOne fair daughter, and no more,\n\tThe which he loved passing well.\n\nPOLONIUS, [aside]  Still on my daughter.\n\nHAMLET  Am I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?\n\nPOLONIUS  If you call me \"Jephthah,\" my lord: I have a\ndaughter that I love passing well.\n\nHAMLET  Nay, that follows not.\n\nPOLONIUS  What follows then, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Why,\n\tAs by lot, God wot\nand then, you know,\n\tIt came to pass, as most like it was--\nthe first row of the pious chanson will show you\nmore, for look where my abridgment comes.\n\n[Enter the Players.]\n\nYou are welcome, masters; welcome all.--I am glad\nto see thee well.--Welcome, good friends.--O my\nold friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee\nlast. Com'st thou to beard me in Denmark?--What,\nmy young lady and mistress! By 'r Lady, your Ladyship\nis nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by\nthe altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a\npiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the\nring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en to 't\nlike French falconers, fly at anything we see. We'll\nhave a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your\nquality. Come, a passionate speech.\n\nFIRST PLAYER  What speech, my good lord?\n\nHAMLET  I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it\nwas never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for\nthe play, I remember, pleased not the million:\n'twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I\nreceived it, and others whose judgments in such\nmatters cried in the top of mine) an excellent play,\nwell digested in the scenes, set down with as much\nmodesty as cunning. I remember one said there\nwere no sallets in the lines to make the matter\nsavory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict\nthe author of affection, but called it an honest\nmethod, as wholesome as sweet and, by very much,\nmore handsome than fine. One speech in 't I\nchiefly loved. 'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido, and\nthereabout of it especially when he speaks of\nPriam's slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at\nthis line--let me see, let me see:\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast--\n'tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:\nThe rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\nWhen he lay couched in th' ominous horse,\nHath now this dread and black complexion smeared\nWith heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,\nNow is he total gules, horridly tricked\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\nBaked and impasted with the parching streets,\nThat lend a tyrannous and a damned light\nTo their lord's murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,\nAnd thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\nOld grandsire Priam seeks.\nSo, proceed you.\n\nPOLONIUS  'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good\naccent and good discretion.\n\nFIRST PLAYER  Anon he finds him\nStriking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\nRepugnant to command. Unequal matched,\nPyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\nTh' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo, his sword,\nWhich was declining on the milky head\nOf reverend Priam, seemed i' th' air to stick.\nSo as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood\nAnd, like a neutral to his will and matter,\nDid nothing.\nBut as we often see against some storm\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\nThe bold winds speechless, and the orb below\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\nDoth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work,\nAnd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\nOn Mars's armor, forged for proof eterne,\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\nNow falls on Priam.\nOut, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods\nIn general synod take away her power,\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven\nAs low as to the fiends!\n\nPOLONIUS  This is too long.\n\nHAMLET  It shall to the barber's with your beard.--\nPrithee say on. He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or\nhe sleeps. Say on; come to Hecuba.\n\nFIRST PLAYER\nBut who, ah woe, had seen the mobled queen--\n\nHAMLET  \"The mobled queen\"?\n\nPOLONIUS  That's good. \"Mobled queen\" is good.\n\nFIRST PLAYER\nRun barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames\nWith bisson rheum, a clout upon that head\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\nAbout her lank and all o'erteemed loins\nA blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up--\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steeped,\n'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have\npronounced.\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\nIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\nThe instant burst of clamor that she made\n(Unless things mortal move them not at all)\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven\nAnd passion in the gods.\n\nPOLONIUS  Look whe'er he has not turned his color and\nhas tears in 's eyes. Prithee, no more.\n\nHAMLET  'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of\nthis soon.--Good my lord, will you see the players\nwell bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used,\nfor they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the\ntime. After your death you were better have a bad\nepitaph than their ill report while you live.\n\nPOLONIUS  My lord, I will use them according to their\ndesert.\n\nHAMLET  God's bodykins, man, much better! Use every\nman after his desert and who shall 'scape\nwhipping? Use them after your own honor and\ndignity. The less they deserve, the more merit is in\nyour bounty. Take them in.\n\nPOLONIUS  Come, sirs.\n\nHAMLET  Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play\ntomorrow. [As Polonius and Players exit, Hamlet speaks to\nthe First Player.] Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can\nyou play \"The Murder of Gonzago\"?\n\nFIRST PLAYER  Ay, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  We'll ha 't tomorrow night. You could, for a\nneed, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen\nlines, which I would set down and insert in 't,\ncould you not?\n\nFIRST PLAYER  Ay, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Very well. Follow that lord--and look you\nmock him not. [First Player exits.] My good friends,\nI'll leave you till night. You are welcome to Elsinore.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Good my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nAy, so, good-bye to you.\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\nNow I am alone.\nO, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!\nIs it not monstrous that this player here,\nBut in a fiction, in a dream of passion,\nCould force his soul so to his own conceit\nThat from her working all his visage wanned,\nTears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,\nA broken voice, and his whole function suiting\nWith forms to his conceit--and all for nothing!\nFor Hecuba!\nWhat's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,\nThat he should weep for her? What would he do\nHad he the motive and the cue for passion\nThat I have? He would drown the stage with tears\nAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech,\nMake mad the guilty and appall the free,\nConfound the ignorant and amaze indeed\nThe very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\nAnd can say nothing--no, not for a king\nUpon whose property and most dear life\nA damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?\nWho calls me \"villain\"? breaks my pate across?\nPlucks off my beard and blows it in my face?\nTweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat\nAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?\nHa! 'Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot be\nBut I am pigeon-livered and lack gall\nTo make oppression bitter, or ere this\nI should have fatted all the region kites\nWith this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!\nRemorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless\nvillain!\nO vengeance!\nWhy, what an ass am I! This is most brave,\nThat I, the son of a dear father murdered,\nPrompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,\nMust, like a whore, unpack my heart with words\nAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,\nA stallion! Fie upon 't! Foh!\nAbout, my brains!--Hum, I have heard\nThat guilty creatures sitting at a play\nHave, by the very cunning of the scene,\nBeen struck so to the soul that presently\nThey have proclaimed their malefactions;\nFor murder, though it have no tongue, will speak\nWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these players\nPlay something like the murder of my father\nBefore mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;\nI'll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,\nI know my course. The spirit that I have seen\nMay be a devil, and the devil hath power\nT' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,\nOut of my weakness and my melancholy,\nAs he is very potent with such spirits,\nAbuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds\nMore relative than this. The play's the thing\nWherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.\n[He exits.]\n\n\nACT 3\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz,\nGuildenstern, and Lords.]\n\n\nKING\nAnd can you by no drift of conference\nGet from him why he puts on this confusion,\nGrating so harshly all his days of quiet\nWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nHe does confess he feels himself distracted,\nBut from what cause he will by no means speak.\n\nGUILDENSTERN\nNor do we find him forward to be sounded,\nBut with a crafty madness keeps aloof\nWhen we would bring him on to some confession\nOf his true state.\n\nQUEEN  Did he receive you well?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Most like a gentleman.\n\nGUILDENSTERN\nBut with much forcing of his disposition.\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nNiggard of question, but of our demands\nMost free in his reply.\n\nQUEEN  Did you assay him to any pastime?\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nMadam, it so fell out that certain players\nWe o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,\nAnd there did seem in him a kind of joy\nTo hear of it. They are here about the court,\nAnd, as I think, they have already order\nThis night to play before him.\n\nPOLONIUS  'Tis most true,\nAnd he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties\nTo hear and see the matter.\n\nKING\nWith all my heart, and it doth much content me\nTo hear him so inclined.\nGood gentlemen, give him a further edge\nAnd drive his purpose into these delights.\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nWe shall, my lord.\t[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\nand Lords exit.]\n\nKING  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,\nFor we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,\nThat he, as 'twere by accident, may here\nAffront Ophelia.\nHer father and myself, lawful espials,\nWill so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,\nWe may of their encounter frankly judge\nAnd gather by him, as he is behaved,\nIf 't be th' affliction of his love or no\nThat thus he suffers for.\n\nQUEEN  I shall obey you.\nAnd for your part, Ophelia, I do wish\nThat your good beauties be the happy cause\nOf Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues\nWill bring him to his wonted way again,\nTo both your honors.\n\nOPHELIA  Madam, I wish it may.\n[Queen exits.]\n\nPOLONIUS\nOphelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please you,\nWe will bestow ourselves. [To Ophelia.] Read on this\nbook,\nThat show of such an exercise may color\nYour loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this\n('Tis too much proved), that with devotion's visage\nAnd pious action we do sugar o'er\nThe devil himself.\n\nKING, [aside]  O, 'tis too true!\nHow smart a lash that speech doth give my\nconscience.\nThe harlot's cheek beautied with plast'ring art\nIs not more ugly to the thing that helps it\nThan is my deed to my most painted word.\nO heavy burden!\n\nPOLONIUS\nI hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.\n[They withdraw.]\n\n[Enter Hamlet.]\n\n\nHAMLET\nTo be or not to be--that is the question:\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\nAnd, by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep--\nNo more--and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heartache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to--'tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--\nTo sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub,\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause. There's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nTh' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\nThe pangs of despised love, the law's delay,\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\nThat patient merit of th' unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscovered country from whose bourn\nNo traveler returns, puzzles the will\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\nAnd lose the name of action.--Soft you now,\nThe fair Ophelia.--Nymph, in thy orisons\nBe all my sins remembered.\n\nOPHELIA  Good my lord,\nHow does your Honor for this many a day?\n\nHAMLET  I humbly thank you, well.\n\nOPHELIA\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\nThat I have longed long to redeliver.\nI pray you now receive them.\n\nHAMLET\nNo, not I. I never gave you aught.\n\nOPHELIA\nMy honored lord, you know right well you did,\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath composed\nAs made the things more rich. Their perfume\nlost,\nTake these again, for to the noble mind\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\nThere, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Ha, ha, are you honest?\n\nOPHELIA  My lord?\n\nHAMLET  Are you fair?\n\nOPHELIA  What means your Lordship?\n\nHAMLET  That if you be honest and fair, your honesty\nshould admit no discourse to your beauty.\n\nOPHELIA  Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce\nthan with honesty?\n\nHAMLET  Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner\ntransform honesty from what it is to a bawd than\nthe force of honesty can translate beauty into his\nlikeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now\nthe time gives it proof. I did love you once.\n\nOPHELIA  Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\n\nHAMLET  You should not have believed me, for virtue\ncannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall\nrelish of it. I loved you not.\n\nOPHELIA  I was the more deceived.\n\nHAMLET  Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be\na breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest,\nbut yet I could accuse me of such things that it\nwere better my mother had not borne me: I am\nvery proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses\nat my beck than I have thoughts to put them\nin, imagination to give them shape, or time to act\nthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawling\nbetween earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves\nall; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.\nWhere's your father?\n\nOPHELIA  At home, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Let the doors be shut upon him that he may\nplay the fool nowhere but in 's own house. Farewell.\n\nOPHELIA  O, help him, you sweet heavens!\n\nHAMLET  If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague\nfor thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as\nsnow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a\nnunnery, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry,\nmarry a fool, for wise men know well enough what\nmonsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and\nquickly too. Farewell.\n\nOPHELIA  Heavenly powers, restore him!\n\nHAMLET  I have heard of your paintings too, well\nenough. God hath given you one face, and you\nmake yourselves another. You jig and amble, and\nyou lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make\nyour wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no\nmore on 't. It hath made me mad. I say we will have\nno more marriage. Those that are married already,\nall but one, shall live. The rest shall keep as they are.\nTo a nunnery, go.\t[He exits.]\n\nOPHELIA\nO, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!\nThe courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue,\nsword,\nTh' expectancy and rose of the fair state,\nThe glass of fashion and the mold of form,\nTh' observed of all observers, quite, quite down!\nAnd I, of ladies most deject and wretched,\nThat sucked the honey of his musicked vows,\nNow see that noble and most sovereign reason,\nLike sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;\nThat unmatched form and stature of blown youth\nBlasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me\nT' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!\n\nKING, [advancing with Polonius]\nLove? His affections do not that way tend;\nNor what he spake, though it lacked form a little,\nWas not like madness. There's something in his soul\nO'er which his melancholy sits on brood,\nAnd I do doubt the hatch and the disclose\nWill be some danger; which for to prevent,\nI have in quick determination\nThus set it down: he shall with speed to England\nFor the demand of our neglected tribute.\nHaply the seas, and countries different,\nWith variable objects, shall expel\nThis something-settled matter in his heart,\nWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus\nFrom fashion of himself. What think you on 't?\n\nPOLONIUS\nIt shall do well. But yet do I believe\nThe origin and commencement of his grief\nSprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia?\nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;\nWe heard it all.--My lord, do as you please,\nBut, if you hold it fit, after the play\nLet his queen-mother all alone entreat him\nTo show his grief. Let her be round with him;\nAnd I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear\nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\nTo England send him, or confine him where\nYour wisdom best shall think.\n\nKING  It shall be so.\nMadness in great ones must not unwatched go.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.]\n\n\nHAMLET  Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced\nit to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth\nit, as many of our players do, I had as lief the\ntown-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air\ntoo much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;\nfor in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,\nwhirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and\nbeget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O,\nit offends me to the soul to hear a robustious,\nperiwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very\nrags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the\nmost part are capable of nothing but inexplicable\ndumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow\nwhipped for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods\nHerod. Pray you, avoid it.\n\nPLAYER  I warrant your Honor.\n\nHAMLET  Be not too tame neither, but let your own\ndiscretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the\nword, the word to the action, with this special\nobservance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of\nnature. For anything so o'erdone is from the purpose\nof playing, whose end, both at the first and\nnow, was and is to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to\nnature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her\nown image, and the very age and body of the time\nhis form and pressure. Now this overdone or come\ntardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh,\ncannot but make the judicious grieve, the censure\nof the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh\na whole theater of others. O, there be players that I\nhave seen play and heard others praise (and that\nhighly), not to speak it profanely, that, neither\nhaving th' accent of Christians nor the gait of\nChristian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and\nbellowed that I have thought some of nature's\njourneymen had made men, and not made them\nwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.\n\nPLAYER  I hope we have reformed that indifferently\nwith us, sir.\n\nHAMLET  O, reform it altogether. And let those that play\nyour clowns speak no more than is set down for\nthem, for there be of them that will themselves\nlaugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators\nto laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary\nquestion of the play be then to be considered.\nThat's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition\nin the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.\n[Players exit.]\n\n[Enter Polonius, Guildenstern, and Rosencrantz.]\n\nHow now, my lord, will the King hear this piece of\nwork?\n\nPOLONIUS  And the Queen too, and that presently.\n\nHAMLET  Bid the players make haste.\t[Polonius exits.]\nWill you two help to hasten them?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, my lord.\t[They exit.]\n\nHAMLET  What ho, Horatio!\n\n[Enter Horatio.]\n\n\nHORATIO  Here, sweet lord, at your service.\n\nHAMLET\nHoratio, thou art e'en as just a man\nAs e'er my conversation coped withal.\n\nHORATIO\nO, my dear lord--\n\nHAMLET  Nay, do not think I flatter,\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee\nThat no revenue hast but thy good spirits\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be\nflattered?\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\nHath sealed thee for herself. For thou hast been\nAs one in suffering all that suffers nothing,\nA man that Fortune's buffets and rewards\nHast ta'en with equal thanks; and blessed are those\nWhose blood and judgment are so well\ncommeddled\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\nThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear him\nIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,\nAs I do thee.--Something too much of this.--\nThere is a play tonight before the King.\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance\nWhich I have told thee of my father's death.\nI prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\nObserve my uncle. If his occulted guilt\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen,\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\nAs Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note,\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face,\nAnd, after, we will both our judgments join\nIn censure of his seeming.\n\nHORATIO  Well, my lord.\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing\nAnd 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\n[Sound a flourish.]\n\nHAMLET  They are coming to the play. I must be idle.\nGet you a place.\n\n[Enter Trumpets and Kettle Drums. Enter King, Queen,\nPolonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and other\nLords attendant with the King's guard carrying\ntorches.]\n\n\nKING  How fares our cousin Hamlet?\n\nHAMLET  Excellent, i' faith, of the chameleon's dish. I\neat the air, promise-crammed. You cannot feed\ncapons so.\n\nKING  I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet. These\nwords are not mine.\n\nHAMLET  No, nor mine now. [To Polonius.] My lord, you\nplayed once i' th' university, you say?\n\nPOLONIUS  That did I, my lord, and was accounted a\ngood actor.\n\nHAMLET  What did you enact?\n\nPOLONIUS  I did enact Julius Caesar. I was killed i' th'\nCapitol. Brutus killed me.\n\nHAMLET  It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a\ncalf there.--Be the players ready?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Ay, my lord. They stay upon your\npatience.\n\nQUEEN  Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.\n\nHAMLET  No, good mother. Here's metal more\nattractive.\t[Hamlet takes a place near Ophelia.]\n\nPOLONIUS, [to the King]  Oh, ho! Do you mark that?\n\nHAMLET  Lady, shall I lie in your lap?\n\nOPHELIA  No, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  I mean, my head upon your lap?\n\nOPHELIA  Ay, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Do you think I meant country matters?\n\nOPHELIA  I think nothing, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  That's a fair thought to lie between maids'\nlegs.\n\nOPHELIA  What is, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Nothing.\n\nOPHELIA  You are merry, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Who, I?\n\nOPHELIA  Ay, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  O God, your only jig-maker. What should a\nman do but be merry? For look you how cheerfully\nmy mother looks, and my father died within 's two\nhours.\n\nOPHELIA  Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  So long? Nay, then, let the devil wear black,\nfor I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens, die two\nmonths ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's\nhope a great man's memory may outlive his life half\na year. But, by 'r Lady, he must build churches, then,\nor else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the\nhobby-horse, whose epitaph is \"For oh, for oh, the\nhobby-horse is forgot.\"\n[The trumpets sounds. Dumb show follows.]\n\n[Enter a King and a Queen, very lovingly, the Queen\nembracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show of\nprotestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his\nhead upon her neck. He lies him down upon a bank of\nflowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon\ncomes in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours\npoison in the sleeper's ears, and leaves him. The Queen\nreturns, finds the King dead, makes passionate action. The\npoisoner with some three or four come in again, seem to\ncondole with her. The dead body is carried away. The\npoisoner woos the Queen with gifts. She seems harsh\nawhile but in the end accepts his love.]\n[Players exit.]\n\nOPHELIA  What means this, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Marry, this is miching mallecho. It means\nmischief.\n\nOPHELIA  Belike this show imports the argument of the\nplay.\n\n[Enter Prologue.]\n\n\nHAMLET  We shall know by this fellow. The players\ncannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.\n\nOPHELIA  Will he tell us what this show meant?\n\nHAMLET  Ay, or any show that you will show him. Be\nnot you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you\nwhat it means.\n\nOPHELIA  You are naught, you are naught. I'll mark the\nplay.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\tFor us and for our tragedy,\n\tHere stooping to your clemency,\n\tWe beg your hearing patiently.\t[He exits.]\n\nHAMLET  Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring?\n\nOPHELIA  'Tis brief, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  As woman's love.\n\n[Enter the Player King and Queen.]\n\n\nPLAYER KING\nFull thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round\nNeptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,\nAnd thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen\nAbout the world have times twelve thirties been\nSince love our hearts and Hymen did our hands\nUnite commutual in most sacred bands.\n\nPLAYER QUEEN\nSo many journeys may the sun and moon\nMake us again count o'er ere love be done!\nBut woe is me! You are so sick of late,\nSo far from cheer and from your former state,\nThat I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,\nDiscomfort you, my lord, it nothing must.\nFor women fear too much, even as they love,\nAnd women's fear and love hold quantity,\nIn neither aught, or in extremity.\nNow what my love is, proof hath made you know,\nAnd, as my love is sized, my fear is so:\nWhere love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;\nWhere little fears grow great, great love grows there.\n\nPLAYER KING\nFaith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too.\nMy operant powers their functions leave to do.\nAnd thou shalt live in this fair world behind,\nHonored, beloved; and haply one as kind\nFor husband shalt thou--\n\nPLAYER QUEEN  O, confound the rest!\nSuch love must needs be treason in my breast.\nIn second husband let me be accurst.\nNone wed the second but who killed the first.\n\nHAMLET  That's wormwood!\n\nPLAYER QUEEN\nThe instances that second marriage move\nAre base respects of thrift, but none of love.\nA second time I kill my husband dead\nWhen second husband kisses me in bed.\n\nPLAYER KING\nI do believe you think what now you speak,\nBut what we do determine oft we break.\nPurpose is but the slave to memory,\nOf violent birth, but poor validity,\nWhich now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree\nBut fall unshaken when they mellow be.\nMost necessary 'tis that we forget\nTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.\nWhat to ourselves in passion we propose,\nThe passion ending, doth the purpose lose.\nThe violence of either grief or joy\nTheir own enactures with themselves destroy.\nWhere joy most revels, grief doth most lament;\nGrief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.\nThis world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange\nThat even our loves should with our fortunes change;\nFor 'tis a question left us yet to prove\nWhether love lead fortune or else fortune love.\nThe great man down, you mark his favorite flies;\nThe poor, advanced, makes friends of enemies.\nAnd hitherto doth love on fortune tend,\nFor who not needs shall never lack a friend,\nAnd who in want a hollow friend doth try\nDirectly seasons him his enemy.\nBut, orderly to end where I begun:\nOur wills and fates do so contrary run\nThat our devices still are overthrown;\nOur thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.\nSo think thou wilt no second husband wed,\nBut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\n\nPLAYER QUEEN\nNor Earth to me give food, nor heaven light,\nSport and repose lock from me day and night,\nTo desperation turn my trust and hope,\nAn anchor's cheer in prison be my scope.\nEach opposite that blanks the face of joy\nMeet what I would have well and it destroy.\nBoth here and hence pursue me lasting strife,\nIf, once a widow, ever I be wife.\n\nHAMLET  If she should break it now!\n\nPLAYER KING\n'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.\nMy spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile\nThe tedious day with sleep.\t[Sleeps.]\n\nPLAYER QUEEN  Sleep rock thy brain,\nAnd never come mischance between us twain.\n[Player Queen exits.]\n\nHAMLET  Madam, how like you this play?\n\nQUEEN  The lady doth protest too much, methinks.\n\nHAMLET  O, but she'll keep her word.\n\nKING  Have you heard the argument? Is there no\noffense in 't?\n\nHAMLET  No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest. No\noffense i' th' world.\n\nKING  What do you call the play?\n\nHAMLET  \"The Mousetrap.\" Marry, how? Tropically.\nThis play is the image of a murder done in Vienna.\nGonzago is the duke's name, his wife Baptista. You\nshall see anon. 'Tis a knavish piece of work, but\nwhat of that? Your Majesty and we that have free\nsouls, it touches us not. Let the galled jade wince;\nour withers are unwrung.\n\n[Enter Lucianus.]\n\nThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.\n\nOPHELIA  You are as good as a chorus, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  I could interpret between you and your love,\nif I could see the puppets dallying.\n\nOPHELIA  You are keen, my lord, you are keen.\n\nHAMLET  It would cost you a groaning to take off mine\nedge.\n\nOPHELIA  Still better and worse.\n\nHAMLET  So you mis-take your husbands.--Begin,\nmurderer.

If not, your pardon and my return\nshall be the end of my business.\n\nHAMLET  Sir, I cannot.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  What, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Make you a wholesome answer. My wit's\ndiseased. But, sir, such answer as I can make, you\nshall command--or, rather, as you say, my mother.\nTherefore no more but to the matter. My mother,\nyou say--\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Then thus she says: your behavior hath\nstruck her into amazement and admiration.\n\nHAMLET  O wonderful son that can so 'stonish a mother!\nBut is there no sequel at the heels of this\nmother's admiration? Impart.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  She desires to speak with you in her\ncloset ere you go to bed.\n\nHAMLET  We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.\nHave you any further trade with us?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  My lord, you once did love me.\n\nHAMLET  And do still, by these pickers and stealers.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Good my lord, what is your cause of\ndistemper? You do surely bar the door upon your\nown liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.\n\nHAMLET  Sir, I lack advancement.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  How can that be, when you have the\nvoice of the King himself for your succession in\nDenmark?\n\nHAMLET  Ay, sir, but \"While the grass grows\"--the\nproverb is something musty.\n\n[Enter the Players with recorders.]\n\nO, the recorders! Let me see one. [He takes a\nrecorder and turns to Guildenstern.] To withdraw\nwith you: why do you go about to recover the wind\nof me, as if you would drive me into a toil?\n\nGUILDENSTERN  O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my\nlove is too unmannerly.\n\nHAMLET  I do not well understand that. Will you play\nupon this pipe?\n\nGUILDENSTERN  My lord, I cannot.\n\nHAMLET  I pray you.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  Believe me, I cannot.\n\nHAMLET  I do beseech you.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  I know no touch of it, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages\nwith your fingers and thumb, give it breath with\nyour mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent\nmusic. Look you, these are the stops.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  But these cannot I command to any\nutt'rance of harmony. I have not the skill.\n\nHAMLET  Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing\nyou make of me! You would play upon me, you\nwould seem to know my stops, you would pluck\nout the heart of my mystery, you would sound me\nfrom my lowest note to the top of my compass;\nand there is much music, excellent voice, in this\nlittle organ, yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood,\ndo you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?\nCall me what instrument you will, though you can\nfret me, you cannot play upon me.\n\n[Enter Polonius.]\n\nGod bless you, sir.\n\nPOLONIUS  My lord, the Queen would speak with you,\nand presently.\n\nHAMLET  Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in\nshape of a camel?\n\nPOLONIUS  By th' Mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.\n\nHAMLET  Methinks it is like a weasel.\n\nPOLONIUS  It is backed like a weasel.\n\nHAMLET  Or like a whale.\n\nPOLONIUS  Very like a whale.\n\nHAMLET  Then I will come to my mother by and by.\n[Aside.] They fool me to the top of my bent.--I will\ncome by and by.\n\nPOLONIUS  I will say so.\n\nHAMLET  \"By and by\" is easily said. Leave me,\nfriends.\n[All but Hamlet exit.]\n'Tis now the very witching time of night,\nWhen churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes\nout\nContagion to this world. Now could I drink hot\nblood\nAnd do such bitter business as the day\nWould quake to look on. Soft, now to my mother.\nO heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever\nThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.\nLet me be cruel, not unnatural.\nI will speak daggers to her, but use none.\nMy tongue and soul in this be hypocrites:\nHow in my words somever she be shent,\nTo give them seals never, my soul, consent.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]\n\n\nKING\nI like him not, nor stands it safe with us\nTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.\nI your commission will forthwith dispatch,\nAnd he to England shall along with you.\nThe terms of our estate may not endure\nHazard so near 's as doth hourly grow\nOut of his brows.\n\nGUILDENSTERN  We will ourselves provide.\nMost holy and religious fear it is\nTo keep those many many bodies safe\nThat live and feed upon your Majesty.\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nThe single and peculiar life is bound\nWith all the strength and armor of the mind\nTo keep itself from noyance, but much more\nThat spirit upon whose weal depends and rests\nThe lives of many. The cess of majesty\nDies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw\nWhat's near it with it; or it is a massy wheel\nFixed on the summit of the highest mount,\nTo whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things\nAre mortised and adjoined, which, when it falls,\nEach small annexment, petty consequence,\nAttends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone\nDid the king sigh, but with a general groan.\n\nKING\nArm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,\nFor we will fetters put about this fear,\nWhich now goes too free-footed.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  We will haste us.\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\n\n[Enter Polonius.]\n\n\nPOLONIUS\nMy lord, he's going to his mother's closet.\nBehind the arras I'll convey myself\nTo hear the process. I'll warrant she'll tax him\nhome;\nAnd, as you said (and wisely was it said),\n'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,\nSince nature makes them partial, should o'erhear\nThe speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.\nI'll call upon you ere you go to bed\nAnd tell you what I know.\n\nKING  Thanks, dear my lord.\n[Polonius exits.]\nO, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;\nIt hath the primal eldest curse upon 't,\nA brother's murder. Pray can I not,\nThough inclination be as sharp as will.\nMy stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,\nAnd, like a man to double business bound,\nI stand in pause where I shall first begin\nAnd both neglect. What if this cursed hand\nWere thicker than itself with brother's blood?\nIs there not rain enough in the sweet heavens\nTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy\nBut to confront the visage of offense?\nAnd what's in prayer but this twofold force,\nTo be forestalled ere we come to fall,\nOr pardoned being down? Then I'll look up.\nMy fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer\nCan serve my turn? \"Forgive me my foul murder\"?\nThat cannot be, since I am still possessed\nOf those effects for which I did the murder:\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\nMay one be pardoned and retain th' offense?\nIn the corrupted currents of this world,\nOffense's gilded hand may shove by justice,\nAnd oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself\nBuys out the law. But 'tis not so above:\nThere is no shuffling; there the action lies\nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compelled,\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\nTo give in evidence. What then? What rests?\nTry what repentance can. What can it not?\nYet what can it, when one cannot repent?\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\nO limed soul, that, struggling to be free,\nArt more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay.\nBow, stubborn knees, and heart with strings of steel\nBe soft as sinews of the newborn babe.\nAll may be well.\t[He kneels.]\n\n[Enter Hamlet.]\n\n\nHAMLET\nNow might I do it pat, now he is a-praying,\nAnd now I'll do 't.\t[He draws his sword.]\nAnd so he goes to heaven,\nAnd so am I revenged. That would be scanned:\nA villain kills my father, and for that,\nI, his sole son, do this same villain send\nTo heaven.\nWhy, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\nAnd how his audit stands who knows save heaven.\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought\n'Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\nWhen he is fit and seasoned for his passage?\nNo.\nUp sword, and know thou a more horrid hent.\n[He sheathes his sword.]\nWhen he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,\nOr in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,\nAt game, a-swearing, or about some act\nThat has no relish of salvation in 't--\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\nAnd that his soul may be as damned and black\nAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.\nThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days.\n[Hamlet exits.]\n\nKING, [rising]\nMy words fly up, my thoughts remain below;\nWords without thoughts never to heaven go.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Queen and Polonius.]\n\n\nPOLONIUS\nHe will come straight. Look you lay home to him.\nTell him his pranks have been too broad to bear\nwith\nAnd that your Grace hath screened and stood\nbetween\nMuch heat and him. I'll silence me even here.\nPray you, be round with him.\n\nHAMLET, [within]  Mother, mother, mother!\n\nQUEEN  I'll warrant you. Fear me not. Withdraw,\nI hear him coming.\n[Polonius hides behind the arras.]\n\n[Enter Hamlet.]\n\n\nHAMLET  Now, mother, what's the matter?\n\nQUEEN\nHamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.\n\nHAMLET\nMother, you have my father much offended.\n\nQUEEN\nCome, come, you answer with an idle tongue.\n\nHAMLET\nGo, go, you question with a wicked tongue.\n\nQUEEN\nWhy, how now, Hamlet?\n\nHAMLET  What's the matter now?\n\nQUEEN\nHave you forgot me?\n\nHAMLET  No, by the rood, not so.\nYou are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,\nAnd (would it were not so) you are my mother.\n\nQUEEN\nNay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.\n\nHAMLET\nCome, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge.\nYou go not till I set you up a glass\nWhere you may see the inmost part of you.\n\nQUEEN\nWhat wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?\nHelp, ho!\n\nPOLONIUS, [behind the arras]  What ho! Help!\n\nHAMLET\nHow now, a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead.\n[He kills Polonius by thrusting a rapier\nthrough the arras.]\n\nPOLONIUS, [behind the arras]\nO, I am slain!\n\nQUEEN  O me, what hast thou done?\n\nHAMLET  Nay, I know not. Is it the King?\n\nQUEEN\nO, what a rash and bloody deed is this!\n\nHAMLET\nA bloody deed--almost as bad, good mother,\nAs kill a king and marry with his brother.\n\nQUEEN\nAs kill a king?\n\nHAMLET  Ay, lady, it was my word.\n[He pulls Polonius' body from behind the arras.]\nThou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell.\nI took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.\nThou find'st to be too busy is some danger.\n[To Queen.] Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit\nyou down,\nAnd let me wring your heart; for so I shall\nIf it be made of penetrable stuff,\nIf damned custom have not brazed it so\nThat it be proof and bulwark against sense.\n\nQUEEN\nWhat have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue\nIn noise so rude against me?\n\nHAMLET  Such an act\nThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,\nCalls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose\nFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love\nAnd sets a blister there, makes marriage vows\nAs false as dicers' oaths--O, such a deed\nAs from the body of contraction plucks\nThe very soul, and sweet religion makes\nA rhapsody of words! Heaven's face does glow\nO'er this solidity and compound mass\nWith heated visage, as against the doom,\nIs thought-sick at the act.\n\nQUEEN  Ay me, what act\nThat roars so loud and thunders in the index?\n\nHAMLET\nLook here upon this picture and on this,\nThe counterfeit presentment of two brothers.\nSee what a grace was seated on this brow,\nHyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself,\nAn eye like Mars' to threaten and command,\nA station like the herald Mercury\nNew-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,\nA combination and a form indeed\nWhere every god did seem to set his seal\nTo give the world assurance of a man.\nThis was your husband. Look you now what follows.\nHere is your husband, like a mildewed ear\nBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?\nCould you on this fair mountain leave to feed\nAnd batten on this moor? Ha! Have you eyes?\nYou cannot call it love, for at your age\nThe heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble\nAnd waits upon the judgment; and what judgment\nWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,\nElse could you not have motion; but sure that sense\nIs apoplexed; for madness would not err,\nNor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled,\nBut it reserved some quantity of choice\nTo serve in such a difference. What devil was 't\nThat thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind?\nEyes without feeling, feeling without sight,\nEars without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,\nOr but a sickly part of one true sense\nCould not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?\nRebellious hell,\nIf thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,\nTo flaming youth let virtue be as wax\nAnd melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame\nWhen the compulsive ardor gives the charge,\nSince frost itself as actively doth burn,\nAnd reason panders will.\n\nQUEEN  O Hamlet, speak no more!\nThou turn'st my eyes into my very soul,\nAnd there I see such black and grained spots\nAs will not leave their tinct.\n\nHAMLET  Nay, but to live\nIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,\nStewed in corruption, honeying and making love\nOver the nasty sty!\n\nQUEEN  O, speak to me no more!\nThese words like daggers enter in my ears.\nNo more, sweet Hamlet!\n\nHAMLET  A murderer and a villain,\nA slave that is not twentieth part the tithe\nOf your precedent lord; a vice of kings,\nA cutpurse of the empire and the rule,\nThat from a shelf the precious diadem stole\nAnd put it in his pocket--\n\nQUEEN  No more!\n\nHAMLET  A king of shreds and patches--\n\n[Enter Ghost.]\n\nSave me and hover o'er me with your wings,\nYou heavenly guards!--What would your gracious\nfigure?\n\nQUEEN  Alas, he's mad.\n\nHAMLET\nDo you not come your tardy son to chide,\nThat, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by\nTh' important acting of your dread command?\nO, say!\n\nGHOST  Do not forget. This visitation\nIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.\nBut look, amazement on thy mother sits.\nO, step between her and her fighting soul.\nConceit in weakest bodies strongest works.\nSpeak to her, Hamlet.\n\nHAMLET  How is it with you, lady?\n\nQUEEN  Alas, how is 't with you,\nThat you do bend your eye on vacancy\nAnd with th' incorporal air do hold discourse?\nForth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,\nAnd, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,\nYour bedded hair, like life in excrements,\nStart up and stand an end. O gentle son,\nUpon the heat and flame of thy distemper\nSprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?\n\nHAMLET\nOn him, on him! Look you how pale he glares.\nHis form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,\nWould make them capable. [To the Ghost.] Do not\nlook upon me,\nLest with this piteous action you convert\nMy stern effects. Then what I have to do\nWill want true color--tears perchance for blood.\n\nQUEEN  To whom do you speak this?\n\nHAMLET  Do you see nothing there?\n\nQUEEN\nNothing at all; yet all that is I see.\n\nHAMLET  Nor did you nothing hear?\n\nQUEEN  No, nothing but ourselves.\n\nHAMLET\nWhy, look you there, look how it steals away!\nMy father, in his habit as he lived!\nLook where he goes even now out at the portal!\n[Ghost exits.]\n\nQUEEN\nThis is the very coinage of your brain.\nThis bodiless creation ecstasy\nIs very cunning in.\n\nHAMLET  Ecstasy?\nMy pulse as yours doth temperately keep time\nAnd makes as healthful music. It is not madness\nThat I have uttered. Bring me to the test,\nAnd I the matter will reword, which madness\nWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,\nLay not that flattering unction to your soul\nThat not your trespass but my madness speaks.\nIt will but skin and film the ulcerous place,\nWhiles rank corruption, mining all within,\nInfects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,\nRepent what's past, avoid what is to come,\nAnd do not spread the compost on the weeds\nTo make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,\nFor, in the fatness of these pursy times,\nVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,\nYea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.\n\nQUEEN\nO Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain!\n\nHAMLET\nO, throw away the worser part of it,\nAnd live the purer with the other half!\nGood night. But go not to my uncle's bed.\nAssume a virtue if you have it not.\nThat monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,\nOf habits devil, is angel yet in this,\nThat to the use of actions fair and good\nHe likewise gives a frock or livery\nThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,\nAnd that shall lend a kind of easiness\nTo the next abstinence, the next more easy;\nFor use almost can change the stamp of nature\nAnd either ... the devil or throw him out\nWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,\nAnd, when you are desirous to be blest,\nI'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord\n[Pointing to Polonius.]\nI do repent; but heaven hath pleased it so\nTo punish me with this and this with me,\nThat I must be their scourge and minister.\nI will bestow him and will answer well\nThe death I gave him. So, again, good night.\nI must be cruel only to be kind.\nThis bad begins, and worse remains behind.\nOne word more, good lady.\n\nQUEEN  What shall I do?\n\nHAMLET\nNot this by no means that I bid you do:\nLet the bloat king tempt you again to bed,\nPinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,\nAnd let him, for a pair of reechy kisses\nOr paddling in your neck with his damned fingers,\nMake you to ravel all this matter out\nThat I essentially am not in madness,\nBut mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,\nFor who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,\nWould from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,\nSuch dear concernings hide? Who would do so?\nNo, in despite of sense and secrecy,\nUnpeg the basket on the house's top,\nLet the birds fly, and like the famous ape,\nTo try conclusions, in the basket creep\nAnd break your own neck down.\n\nQUEEN\nBe thou assured, if words be made of breath\nAnd breath of life, I have no life to breathe\nWhat thou hast said to me.\n\nHAMLET\nI must to England, you know that.\n\nQUEEN  Alack,\nI had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.\n\nHAMLET\nThere's letters sealed; and my two schoolfellows,\nWhom I will trust as I will adders fanged,\nThey bear the mandate; they must sweep my way\nAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work,\nFor 'tis the sport to have the enginer\nHoist with his own petard; and 't shall go hard\nBut I will delve one yard below their mines\nAnd blow them at the moon. O, 'tis most sweet\nWhen in one line two crafts directly meet.\nThis man shall set me packing.\nI'll lug the guts into the neighbor room.\nMother, good night indeed. This counselor\nIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,\nWho was in life a foolish prating knave.--\nCome, sir, to draw toward an end with you.--\nGood night, mother.\n[They exit, Hamlet tugging in Polonius.]\n\n\nACT 4\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter King and Queen, with Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstern.]\n\n\nKING\nThere's matter in these sighs; these profound heaves\nYou must translate; 'tis fit we understand them.\nWhere is your son?\n\nQUEEN\nBestow this place on us a little while.\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\nAh, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!\n\nKING  What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?\n\nQUEEN\nMad as the sea and wind when both contend\nWhich is the mightier. In his lawless fit,\nBehind the arras hearing something stir,\nWhips out his rapier, cries \"A rat, a rat,\"\nAnd in this brainish apprehension kills\nThe unseen good old man.\n\nKING  O heavy deed!\nIt had been so with us, had we been there.\nHis liberty is full of threats to all--\nTo you yourself, to us, to everyone.\nAlas, how shall this bloody deed be answered?\nIt will be laid to us, whose providence\nShould have kept short, restrained, and out of haunt\nThis mad young man. But so much was our love,\nWe would not understand what was most fit,\nBut, like the owner of a foul disease,\nTo keep it from divulging, let it feed\nEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone?\n\nQUEEN\nTo draw apart the body he hath killed,\nO'er whom his very madness, like some ore\nAmong a mineral of metals base,\nShows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.\n\nKING  O Gertrude, come away!\nThe sun no sooner shall the mountains touch\nBut we will ship him hence; and this vile deed\nWe must with all our majesty and skill\nBoth countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!\n\n[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]\n\nFriends both, go join you with some further aid.\nHamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,\nAnd from his mother's closet hath he dragged him.\nGo seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body\nInto the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.\n[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.]\nCome, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends\nAnd let them know both what we mean to do\nAnd what's untimely done. ...\nWhose whisper o'er the world's diameter,\nAs level as the cannon to his blank\nTransports his poisoned shot, may miss our name\nAnd hit the woundless air. O, come away!\nMy soul is full of discord and dismay.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Hamlet.]\n\n\nHAMLET  Safely stowed.\n\nGENTLEMEN, [within]  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!\n\nHAMLET  But soft, what noise? Who calls on Hamlet?\nO, here they come.\n\n[Enter Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]\n\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nWhat have you done, my lord, with the dead body?\n\nHAMLET\nCompounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nTell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence\nAnd bear it to the chapel.\n\nHAMLET  Do not believe it.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Believe what?\n\nHAMLET  That I can keep your counsel and not mine\nown. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what\nreplication should be made by the son of a king?\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Take you me for a sponge, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Ay, sir, that soaks up the King's countenance,\nhis rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the\nKing best service in the end. He keeps them like an\nape an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed,\nto be last swallowed. When he needs what you have\ngleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you\nshall be dry again.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  I understand you not, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a\nfoolish ear.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  My lord, you must tell us where the\nbody is and go with us to the King.\n\nHAMLET  The body is with the King, but the King is not\nwith the body. The King is a thing--\n\nGUILDENSTERN  A \"thing,\" my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and\nall after!\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter King and two or three.]\n\n\nKING\nI have sent to seek him and to find the body.\nHow dangerous is it that this man goes loose!\nYet must not we put the strong law on him.\nHe's loved of the distracted multitude,\nWho like not in their judgment, but their eyes;\nAnd, where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weighed,\nBut never the offense. To bear all smooth and even,\nThis sudden sending him away must seem\nDeliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown\nBy desperate appliance are relieved\nOr not at all.\n\n[Enter Rosencrantz.]\n\nHow now, what hath befallen?\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nWhere the dead body is bestowed, my lord,\nWe cannot get from him.\n\nKING  But where is he?\n\nROSENCRANTZ\nWithout, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.\n\nKING\nBring him before us.\n\nROSENCRANTZ  Ho! Bring in the lord.\n\n[They enter with Hamlet.]\n\n\nKING  Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?\n\nHAMLET  At supper.\n\nKING  At supper where?\n\nHAMLET  Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A\ncertain convocation of politic worms are e'en at\nhim. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We\nfat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves\nfor maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is\nbut variable service--two dishes but to one table.\nThat's the end.\n\nKING  Alas, alas!\n\nHAMLET  A man may fish with the worm that hath eat\nof a king and eat of the fish that hath fed of that\nworm.\n\nKING  What dost thou mean by this?\n\nHAMLET  Nothing but to show you how a king may go a\nprogress through the guts of a beggar.\n\nKING  Where is Polonius?\n\nHAMLET  In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger\nfind him not there, seek him i' th' other\nplace yourself. But if, indeed, you find him not\nwithin this month, you shall nose him as you go up\nthe stairs into the lobby.\n\nKING, [to Attendants.]  Go, seek him there.\n\nHAMLET  He will stay till you come.\t[Attendants exit.]\n\nKING\nHamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety\n(Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve\nFor that which thou hast done) must send thee\nhence\nWith fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.\nThe bark is ready, and the wind at help,\nTh' associates tend, and everything is bent\nFor England.\n\nHAMLET  For England?\n\nKING  Ay, Hamlet.\n\nHAMLET  Good.\n\nKING\nSo is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.\n\nHAMLET\nI see a cherub that sees them. But come, for\nEngland.\nFarewell, dear mother.\n\nKING  Thy loving father, Hamlet.\n\nHAMLET\nMy mother. Father and mother is man and wife,\nMan and wife is one flesh, and so, my mother.--\nCome, for England.\t[He exits.]\n\nKING\nFollow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.\nDelay it not. I'll have him hence tonight.\nAway, for everything is sealed and done\nThat else leans on th' affair. Pray you, make haste.\n[All but the King exit.]\nAnd England, if my love thou hold'st at aught\n(As my great power thereof may give thee sense,\nSince yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red\nAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awe\nPays homage to us), thou mayst not coldly set\nOur sovereign process, which imports at full,\nBy letters congruing to that effect,\nThe present death of Hamlet.

A beast, no more.\nSure He that made us with such large discourse,\nLooking before and after, gave us not\nThat capability and godlike reason\nTo fust in us unused. Now whether it be\nBestial oblivion or some craven scruple\nOf thinking too precisely on th' event\n(A thought which, quartered, hath but one part\nwisdom\nAnd ever three parts coward), I do not know\nWhy yet I live to say \"This thing's to do,\"\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\nTo do 't. Examples gross as Earth exhort me:\nWitness this army of such mass and charge,\nLed by a delicate and tender prince,\nWhose spirit with divine ambition puffed\nMakes mouths at the invisible event,\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\nIs not to stir without great argument,\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\nWhen honor's at the stake. How stand I, then,\nThat have a father killed, a mother stained,\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men\nThat for a fantasy and trick of fame\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\nTo hide the slain?

[Gentleman exits.] I do not\nknow from what part of the world I should be\ngreeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.\n\n[Enter Sailors.]\n\n\nSAILOR  God bless you, sir.\n\nHORATIO  Let Him bless thee too.\n\nSAILOR  He shall, sir, an 't please Him. There's a letter\nfor you, sir. It came from th' ambassador that was\nbound for England--if your name be Horatio, as I\nam let to know it is.\t[He hands Horatio a letter.]\n\nHORATIO [reads the letter]  Horatio, when thou shalt have\noverlooked this, give these fellows some means to the\nKing. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days\nold at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave\nus chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on\na compelled valor, and in the grapple I boarded them.\nOn the instant, they got clear of our ship; so I alone\nbecame their prisoner. They have dealt with me like\nthieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to\ndo a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters\nI have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed\nas thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in\nthine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too\nlight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows\nwill bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\nhold their course for England; of them I have\nmuch to tell thee. Farewell.\nHe that thou knowest thine,\nHamlet.\nCome, I will give you way for these your letters\nAnd do 't the speedier that you may direct me\nTo him from whom you brought them.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 7\n=======\n[Enter King and Laertes.]\n\n\nKING\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\nPursued my life.\n\nLAERTES  It well appears. But tell me\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\nSo criminal and so capital in nature,\nAs by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else,\nYou mainly were stirred up.\n\nKING  O, for two special reasons,\nWhich may to you perhaps seem much unsinewed,\nBut yet to me they're strong. The Queen his mother\nLives almost by his looks, and for myself\n(My virtue or my plague, be it either which),\nShe is so conjunctive to my life and soul\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\nI could not but by her. The other motive\nWhy to a public count I might not go\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\nWork like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\nConvert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,\nToo slightly timbered for so loud a wind,\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\nBut not where I have aimed them.\n\nLAERTES\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\nA sister driven into desp'rate terms,\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\n\nKING\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\nI loved your father, and we love ourself,\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--\n\n[Enter a Messenger with letters.]\n\nHow now? What news?\n\nMESSENGER  Letters, my lord, from\nHamlet.\nThese to your Majesty, this to the Queen.\n\nKING  From Hamlet? Who brought them?\n\nMESSENGER\nSailors, my lord, they say. I saw them not.\nThey were given me by Claudio. He received them\nOf him that brought them.\n\nKING  Laertes, you shall hear\nthem.--\nLeave us.\t[Messenger exits.]\n[Reads.] High and mighty, you shall know I am set\nnaked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to\nsee your kingly eyes, when I shall (first asking your\npardon) thereunto recount the occasion of my sudden\nand more strange return. Hamlet.\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\nOr is it some abuse and no such thing?\n\nLAERTES  Know you the hand?\n\nKING  'Tis Hamlet's character. \"Naked\"--\nAnd in a postscript here, he says \"alone.\"\nCan you advise me?\n\nLAERTES\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come.\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth\n\"Thus didst thou.\"\n\nKING  If it be so, Laertes\n(As how should it be so? how otherwise?),\nWill you be ruled by me?\n\nLAERTES  Ay, my lord,\nSo you will not o'errule me to a peace.\n\nKING\nTo thine own peace. If he be now returned,\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\nAnd for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\nAnd call it accident.\n\nLAERTES  My lord, I will be ruled,\nThe rather if you could devise it so\nThat I might be the organ.\n\nKING  It falls right.\nYou have been talked of since your travel much,\nAnd that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\nOf the unworthiest siege.\n\nLAERTES  What part is that, my lord?\n\nKING\nA very ribbon in the cap of youth--\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy.\nI have seen myself, and served against, the French,\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\nHad witchcraft in 't. He grew unto his seat,\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse\nAs had he been encorpsed and demi-natured\nWith the brave beast. So far he topped my thought\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks\nCome short of what he did.\n\nLAERTES  A Norman was 't?\n\nKING  A Norman.\n\nLAERTES\nUpon my life, Lamord.\n\nKING  The very same.\n\nLAERTES\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\nAnd gem of all the nation.\n\nKING  He made confession of you\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\nFor art and exercise in your defense,\nAnd for your rapier most especial,\nThat he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed\nIf one could match you. The 'scrimers of their\nnation\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\nIf you opposed them. Sir, this report of his\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\nYour sudden coming-o'er, to play with you.\nNow out of this--\n\nLAERTES  What out of this, my lord?\n\nKING\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\nA face without a heart?\n\nLAERTES  Why ask you this?\n\nKING\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\nBut that I know love is begun by time\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\nThere lives within the very flame of love\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it,\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still;\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\nDies in his own too-much. That we would do\nWe should do when we would; for this \"would\"\nchanges\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\nAnd then this \"should\" is like a spendthrift sigh,\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick of th' ulcer:\nHamlet comes back; what would you undertake\nTo show yourself indeed your father's son\nMore than in words?\n\nLAERTES  To cut his throat i' th' church.\n\nKING\nNo place indeed should murder sanctuarize;\nRevenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,\nWill you do this? Keep close within your chamber.\nHamlet, returned, shall know you are come home.\nWe'll put on those shall praise your excellence\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\nThe Frenchman gave you; bring you, in fine,\ntogether\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\nWill not peruse the foils, so that with ease,\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice\nRequite him for your father.\n\nLAERTES  I will do 't,\nAnd for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\nThat is but scratched withal. I'll touch my point\nWith this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,\nIt may be death.\n\nKING  Let's further think of this,\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\nAnd that our drift look through our bad\nperformance,\n'Twere better not assayed. Therefore this project\nShould have a back or second that might hold\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\nWe'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings--\nI ha 't!\nWhen in your motion you are hot and dry\n(As make your bouts more violent to that end)\nAnd that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared\nhim\nA chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,\nIf he by chance escape your venomed stuck,\nOur purpose may hold there.--But stay, what\nnoise?\n\n[Enter Queen.]\n\n\nQUEEN\nOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,\nSo fast they follow. Your sister's drowned, Laertes.\n\nLAERTES  Drowned? O, where?\n\nQUEEN\nThere is a willow grows askant the brook\nThat shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.\nTherewith fantastic garlands did she make\nOf crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\nBut our cold maids do \"dead men's fingers\" call\nthem.\nThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\nClamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\nAnd mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,\nWhich time she chanted snatches of old lauds,\nAs one incapable of her own distress\nOr like a creature native and endued\nUnto that element. But long it could not be\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\nPulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay\nTo muddy death.\n\nLAERTES  Alas, then she is drowned.\n\nQUEEN  Drowned, drowned.\n\nLAERTES\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears. But yet\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\nLet shame say what it will. When these are gone,\nThe woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord.\nI have a speech o' fire that fain would blaze,\nBut that this folly drowns it.\t[He exits.]\n\nKING  Let's follow, Gertrude.\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\nNow fear I this will give it start again.\nTherefore, let's follow.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 5\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Gravedigger and Another.]\n\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Is she to be buried in Christian burial,\nwhen she willfully seeks her own salvation?\n\nOTHER  I tell thee she is. Therefore make her grave\nstraight. The crowner hath sat on her and finds it\nChristian burial.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  How can that be, unless she drowned\nherself in her own defense?\n\nOTHER  Why, 'tis found so.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  It must be se offendendo; it cannot be\nelse. For here lies the point: if I drown myself\nwittingly, it argues an act, and an act hath three\nbranches--it is to act, to do, to perform. Argal, she\ndrowned herself wittingly.\n\nOTHER  Nay, but hear you, goodman delver--\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Give me leave. Here lies the water;\ngood. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to\nthis water and drown himself, it is (will he, nill he)\nhe goes; mark you that. But if the water come to him\nand drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he\nthat is not guilty of his own death shortens not his\nown life.\n\nOTHER  But is this law?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Ay, marry, is 't--crowner's 'quest law.\n\nOTHER  Will you ha' the truth on 't? If this had not been\na gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'\nChristian burial.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, there thou sayst. And the more\npity that great folk should have count'nance in this\nworld to drown or hang themselves more than\ntheir even-Christian. Come, my spade.

Go, get thee in, and fetch me a\nstoup of liquor.\n[The Other Man exits\nand the Gravedigger digs and sings.]\n\tIn youth when I did love, did love,\n\t   Methought it was very sweet\n\tTo contract--O--the time for--a--my behove,\n\t   O, methought there--a--was nothing--a--meet.\n\nHAMLET  Has this fellow no feeling of his business? He\nsings in grave-making.\n\nHORATIO  Custom hath made it in him a property of\neasiness.\n\nHAMLET  'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment\nhath the daintier sense.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER [sings]\n\tBut age with his stealing steps\n\tHath clawed me in his clutch,\n\tAnd hath shipped me into the land,\n\tAs if I had never been such.\n[He digs up a skull.]\n\nHAMLET  That skull had a tongue in it and could sing\nonce. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if\n'twere Cain's jawbone, that did the first murder!\nThis might be the pate of a politician which this ass\nnow o'erreaches, one that would circumvent God,\nmight it not?\n\nHORATIO  It might, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Or of a courtier, which could say \"Good\nmorrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?\"\nThis might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my\nLord Such-a-one's horse when he went to beg it,\nmight it not?\n\nHORATIO  Ay, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Why, e'en so. And now my Lady Worm's,\nchapless and knocked about the mazard with a\nsexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, an we had\nthe trick to see 't. Did these bones cost no more the\nbreeding but to play at loggets with them? Mine\nache to think on 't.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER [sings]\n\tA pickax and a spade, a spade,\n\tFor and a shrouding sheet,\n\tO, a pit of clay for to be made\n\tFor such a guest is meet.\n[He digs up more skulls.]\n\nHAMLET  There's another. Why may not that be the\nskull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his\nquillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why\ndoes he suffer this mad knave now to knock him\nabout the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell\nhim of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow might\nbe in 's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,\nhis recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,\nhis recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the\nrecovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full\nof fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more\nof his purchases, and double ones too, than the\nlength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very\nconveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box,\nand must th' inheritor himself have no more, ha?\n\nHORATIO  Not a jot more, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  Is not parchment made of sheepskins?\n\nHORATIO  Ay, my lord, and of calves' skins too.\n\nHAMLET  They are sheep and calves which seek out\nassurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.--\nWhose grave's this, sirrah?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Mine, sir.\n[Sings.]\tO, a pit of clay for to be made\n\tFor such a guest is meet.\n\nHAMLET  I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in 't.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  You lie out on 't, sir, and therefore 'tis\nnot yours. For my part, I do not lie in 't, yet it is\nmine.\n\nHAMLET  Thou dost lie in 't, to be in 't and say it is thine.\n'Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou\nliest.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again\nfrom me to you.\n\nHAMLET  What man dost thou dig it for?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  For no man, sir.\n\nHAMLET  What woman then?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  For none, neither.\n\nHAMLET  Who is to be buried in 't?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  One that was a woman, sir, but, rest\nher soul, she's dead.\n\nHAMLET  How absolute the knave is! We must speak by\nthe card, or equivocation will undo us. By the\nLord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of\nit: the age is grown so picked that the toe of the\npeasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he\ngalls his kibe.--How long hast thou been\ngrave-maker?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Of all the days i' th' year, I came to 't\nthat day that our last King Hamlet overcame\nFortinbras.\n\nHAMLET  How long is that since?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Cannot you tell that? Every fool can\ntell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet\nwas born--he that is mad, and sent into England.\n\nHAMLET  Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, because he was mad. He shall\nrecover his wits there. Or if he do not, 'tis no great\nmatter there.\n\nHAMLET  Why?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  'Twill not be seen in him there. There\nthe men are as mad as he.\n\nHAMLET  How came he mad?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Very strangely, they say.\n\nHAMLET  How \"strangely\"?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Faith, e'en with losing his wits.\n\nHAMLET  Upon what ground?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, here in Denmark. I have been\nsexton here, man and boy, thirty years.\n\nHAMLET  How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Faith, if he be not rotten before he die\n(as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will\nscarce hold the laying in), he will last you some\neight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine\nyear.\n\nHAMLET  Why he more than another?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his\ntrade that he will keep out water a great while; and\nyour water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead\nbody. Here's a skull now hath lien you i' th' earth\nthree-and-twenty years.\n\nHAMLET  Whose was it?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  A whoreson mad fellow's it was.\nWhose do you think it was?\n\nHAMLET  Nay, I know not.\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!\nHe poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.\nThis same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick's skull, the\nKing's jester.\n\nHAMLET  This?\n\nGRAVEDIGGER  E'en that.\n\nHAMLET, [taking the skull]  Let me see. Alas, poor\nYorick! I knew him, Horatio--a fellow of infinite\njest, of most excellent fancy. He hath bore me on his\nback a thousand times, and now how abhorred in\nmy imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung\nthose lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.\nWhere be your gibes now? your gambols? your\nsongs? your flashes of merriment that were wont to\nset the table on a roar? Not one now to mock your\nown grinning? Quite chapfallen? Now get you to my\nlady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch\nthick, to this favor she must come. Make her laugh\nat that.--Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.\n\nHORATIO  What's that, my lord?\n\nHAMLET  Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this\nfashion i' th' earth?\n\nHORATIO  E'en so.\n\nHAMLET  And smelt so? Pah!\t[He puts the skull down.]\n\nHORATIO  E'en so, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  To what base uses we may return, Horatio!\nWhy may not imagination trace the noble dust of\nAlexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?\n\nHORATIO  'Twere to consider too curiously to consider\nso.\n\nHAMLET  No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither,\nwith modesty enough and likelihood to lead it, as\nthus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander\nreturneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth\nwe make loam; and why of that loam whereto he\nwas converted might they not stop a beer barrel?\nImperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay,\nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away.\nO, that that earth which kept the world in awe\nShould patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!\n\n[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords attendant, and the\ncorpse of Ophelia, with a Doctor of Divinity.]\n\nBut soft, but soft awhile! Here comes the King,\nThe Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken\nThe corse they follow did with desp'rate hand\nFordo its own life. 'Twas of some estate.\nCouch we awhile and mark.\t[They step aside.]\n\nLAERTES  What ceremony else?\n\nHAMLET  That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.\n\nLAERTES  What ceremony else?\n\nDOCTOR\nHer obsequies have been as far enlarged\nAs we have warranty. Her death was doubtful,\nAnd, but that great command o'ersways the order,\nShe should in ground unsanctified been lodged\nTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayers\nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on\nher.\nYet here she is allowed her virgin crants,\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home\nOf bell and burial.\n\nLAERTES\nMust there no more be done?\n\nDOCTOR  No more be done.\nWe should profane the service of the dead\nTo sing a requiem and such rest to her\nAs to peace-parted souls.\n\nLAERTES  Lay her i' th' earth,\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\nMay violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,\nA minist'ring angel shall my sister be\nWhen thou liest howling.\n\nHAMLET, [to Horatio]  What, the fair Ophelia?\n\nQUEEN  Sweets to the sweet, farewell!\n[She scatters flowers.]\nI hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;\nI thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid,\nAnd not have strewed thy grave.\n\nLAERTES  O, treble woe\nFall ten times treble on that cursed head\nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense\nDeprived thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,\nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.\n[Leaps in the grave.]\nNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,\nTill of this flat a mountain you have made\nT' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head\nOf blue Olympus.\n\nHAMLET, [advancing]\nWhat is he whose grief\nBears such an emphasis, whose phrase of sorrow\nConjures the wand'ring stars and makes them stand\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\nHamlet the Dane.\n\nLAERTES, [coming out of the grave]\nThe devil take thy soul!\n\nHAMLET  Thou pray'st not well.\t[They grapple.]\nI prithee take thy fingers from my throat,\nFor though I am not splenitive and rash,\nYet have I in me something dangerous,\nWhich let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand.\n\nKING  Pluck them asunder.\n\nQUEEN  Hamlet! Hamlet!\n\nALL  Gentlemen!\n\nHORATIO  Good my lord, be quiet.\n[Hamlet and Laertes are separated.]\n\nHAMLET\nWhy, I will fight with him upon this theme\nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag!\n\nQUEEN  O my son, what theme?\n\nHAMLET\nI loved Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers\nCould not with all their quantity of love\nMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?\n\nKING  O, he is mad, Laertes!\n\nQUEEN  For love of God, forbear him.\n\nHAMLET  'Swounds, show me what thou 't do.\nWoo't weep, woo't fight, woo't fast, woo't tear\nthyself,\nWoo't drink up eisel, eat a crocodile?\nI'll do 't. Dost thou come here to whine?\nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?\nBe buried quick with her, and so will I.\nAnd if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,\nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,\nMake Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou 'lt mouth,\nI'll rant as well as thou.\n\nQUEEN  This is mere madness;\nAnd thus awhile the fit will work on him.\nAnon, as patient as the female dove\nWhen that her golden couplets are disclosed,\nHis silence will sit drooping.\n\nHAMLET  Hear you, sir,\nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?\nI loved you ever. But it is no matter.\nLet Hercules himself do what he may,\nThe cat will mew, and dog will have his day.\n[Hamlet exits.]\n\nKING\nI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.\n[Horatio exits.]\n[To Laertes.] Strengthen your patience in our last\nnight's speech.\nWe'll put the matter to the present push.--\nGood Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--\nThis grave shall have a living monument.\nAn hour of quiet thereby shall we see.\nTill then in patience our proceeding be.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]\n\n\nHAMLET\nSo much for this, sir. Now shall you see the other.\nYou do remember all the circumstance?\n\nHORATIO  Remember it, my lord!\n\nHAMLET\nSir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\nThat would not let me sleep. Methought I lay\nWorse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly--\nAnd praised be rashness for it; let us know,\nOur indiscretion sometime serves us well\nWhen our deep plots do pall; and that should learn\nus\nThere's a divinity that shapes our ends,\nRough-hew them how we will--\n\nHORATIO  That is most\ncertain.\n\nHAMLET  Up from my cabin,\nMy sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark\nGroped I to find out them; had my desire,\nFingered their packet, and in fine withdrew\nTo mine own room again, making so bold\n(My fears forgetting manners) to unfold\nTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,\nA royal knavery--an exact command,\nLarded with many several sorts of reasons\nImporting Denmark's health and England's too,\nWith--ho!--such bugs and goblins in my life,\nThat on the supervise, no leisure bated,\nNo, not to stay the grinding of the ax,\nMy head should be struck off.\n\nHORATIO  Is 't possible?\n\nHAMLET\nHere's the commission. Read it at more leisure.\n[Handing him a paper.]\nBut wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?\n\nHORATIO  I beseech you.\n\nHAMLET\nBeing thus benetted round with villainies,\nOr I could make a prologue to my brains,\nThey had begun the play. I sat me down,\nDevised a new commission, wrote it fair--\nI once did hold it, as our statists do,\nA baseness to write fair, and labored much\nHow to forget that learning; but, sir, now\nIt did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know\nTh' effect of what I wrote?\n\nHORATIO  Ay, good my lord.\n\nHAMLET\nAn earnest conjuration from the King,\nAs England was his faithful tributary,\nAs love between them like the palm might flourish,\nAs peace should still her wheaten garland wear\nAnd stand a comma 'tween their amities,\nAnd many suchlike ases of great charge,\nThat, on the view and knowing of these contents,\nWithout debatement further, more or less,\nHe should those bearers put to sudden death,\nNot shriving time allowed.\n\nHORATIO  How was this sealed?\n\nHAMLET\nWhy, even in that was heaven ordinant.\nI had my father's signet in my purse,\nWhich was the model of that Danish seal;\nFolded the writ up in the form of th' other,\nSubscribed it, gave 't th' impression, placed it\nsafely,\nThe changeling never known. Now, the next day\nWas our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent\nThou knowest already.\n\nHORATIO\nSo Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to 't.\n\nHAMLET\nWhy, man, they did make love to this employment.\nThey are not near my conscience. Their defeat\nDoes by their own insinuation grow.\n'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes\nBetween the pass and fell incensed points\nOf mighty opposites.\n\nHORATIO  Why, what a king is this!\n\nHAMLET\nDoes it not, think thee, stand me now upon--\nHe that hath killed my king and whored my mother,\nPopped in between th' election and my hopes,\nThrown out his angle for my proper life,\nAnd with such cozenage--is 't not perfect\nconscience\nTo quit him with this arm? And is 't not to be\ndamned\nTo let this canker of our nature come\nIn further evil?\n\nHORATIO\nIt must be shortly known to him from England\nWhat is the issue of the business there.\n\nHAMLET\nIt will be short. The interim's mine,\nAnd a man's life's no more than to say \"one.\"\nBut I am very sorry, good Horatio,\nThat to Laertes I forgot myself,\nFor by the image of my cause I see\nThe portraiture of his. I'll court his favors.\nBut, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me\nInto a tow'ring passion.\n\nHORATIO  Peace, who comes here?\n\n[Enter Osric, a courtier.]\n\n\nOSRIC  Your Lordship is right welcome back to\nDenmark.\n\nHAMLET  I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio.]\nDost know this waterfly?\n\nHORATIO, [aside to Hamlet]  No, my good lord.\n\nHAMLET, [aside to Horatio]  Thy state is the more gracious,\nfor 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much\nland, and fertile. Let a beast be lord of beasts and his\ncrib shall stand at the king's mess. 'Tis a chough,\nbut, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.\n\nOSRIC  Sweet lord, if your Lordship were at leisure, I\nshould impart a thing to you from his Majesty.\n\nHAMLET  I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of\nspirit. Put your bonnet to his right use: 'tis for the\nhead.\n\nOSRIC  I thank your Lordship; it is very hot.\n\nHAMLET  No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is\nnortherly.\n\nOSRIC  It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.\n\nHAMLET  But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for\nmy complexion.\n\nOSRIC  Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as\n'twere--I cannot tell how. My lord, his Majesty\nbade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager\non your head. Sir, this is the matter--\n\nHAMLET  I beseech you, remember. [He motions to\nOsric to put on his hat.]\n\nOSRIC  Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.\nSir, here is newly come to court Laertes--believe\nme, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent\ndifferences, of very soft society and great showing.\nIndeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or\ncalendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the\ncontinent of what part a gentleman would see.\n\nHAMLET  Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in\nyou, though I know to divide him inventorially\nwould dozy th' arithmetic of memory, and yet but\nyaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the\nverity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great\narticle, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness\nas, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his\nmirror, and who else would trace him, his umbrage,\nnothing more.\n\nOSRIC  Your Lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\n\nHAMLET  The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the\ngentleman in our more rawer breath?\n\nOSRIC  Sir?\n\nHORATIO  Is 't not possible to understand in another\ntongue? You will to 't, sir, really.\n\nHAMLET, [to Osric]  What imports the nomination of\nthis gentleman?\n\nOSRIC  Of Laertes?\n\nHORATIO  His purse is empty already; all 's golden words\nare spent.\n\nHAMLET  Of him, sir.\n\nOSRIC  I know you are not ignorant--\n\nHAMLET  I would you did, sir. Yet, in faith, if you did, it\nwould not much approve me. Well, sir?\n\nOSRIC  You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes\nis--\n\nHAMLET  I dare not confess that, lest I should compare\nwith him in excellence. But to know a man well\nwere to know himself.\n\nOSRIC  I mean, sir, for his weapon. But in the imputation\nlaid on him by them, in his meed he's\nunfellowed.\n\nHAMLET  What's his weapon?\n\nOSRIC  Rapier and dagger.\n\nHAMLET  That's two of his weapons. But, well--\n\nOSRIC  The King, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary\nhorses, against the which he has impawned, as I\ntake it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their\nassigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the\ncarriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very\nresponsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and\nof very liberal conceit.\n\nHAMLET  What call you the \"carriages\"?\n\nHORATIO  I knew you must be edified by the margent\nere you had done.\n\nOSRIC  The carriages, sir, are the hangers.\n\nHAMLET  The phrase would be more germane to the\nmatter if we could carry a cannon by our sides. I\nwould it might be \"hangers\" till then. But on. Six\nBarbary horses against six French swords, their\nassigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages--\nthat's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this\nall \"impawned,\" as you call it?\n\nOSRIC  The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen\npasses between yourself and him, he shall not\nexceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for\nnine, and it would come to immediate trial if your\nLordship would vouchsafe the answer.\n\nHAMLET  How if I answer no?\n\nOSRIC  I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person\nin trial.\n\nHAMLET  Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his\nMajesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let\nthe foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the\nKing hold his purpose, I will win for him, an I can.\nIf not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd\nhits.\n\nOSRIC  Shall I deliver you e'en so?\n\nHAMLET  To this effect, sir, after what flourish your\nnature will.\n\nOSRIC  I commend my duty to your Lordship.\n\nHAMLET  Yours. [Osric exits.] He does well to commend\nit himself. There are no tongues else for 's\nturn.\n\nHORATIO  This lapwing runs away with the shell on his\nhead.\n\nHAMLET  He did comply, sir, with his dug before he\nsucked it. Thus has he (and many more of the same\nbreed that I know the drossy age dotes on) only got\nthe tune of the time, and, out of an habit of\nencounter, a kind of yeasty collection, which carries\nthem through and through the most fanned\nand winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to\ntheir trial, the bubbles are out.\n\n[Enter a Lord.]\n\n\nLORD  My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by\nyoung Osric, who brings back to him that you\nattend him in the hall. He sends to know if your\npleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will\ntake longer time.\n\nHAMLET  I am constant to my purposes. They follow\nthe King's pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is\nready now or whensoever, provided I be so able as\nnow.\n\nLORD  The King and Queen and all are coming down.\n\nHAMLET  In happy time.\n\nLORD  The Queen desires you to use some gentle\nentertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.\n\nHAMLET  She well instructs me.\t[Lord exits.]\n\nHORATIO  You will lose, my lord.\n\nHAMLET  I do not think so. Since he went into France, I\nhave been in continual practice. I shall win at the\nodds; but thou wouldst not think how ill all's here\nabout my heart. But it is no matter.\n\nHORATIO  Nay, good my lord--\n\nHAMLET  It is but foolery, but it is such a kind of\ngaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman.\n\nHORATIO  If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will\nforestall their repair hither and say you are not fit.\n\nHAMLET  Not a whit. We defy augury. There is a\nspecial providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be\nnow, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be\nnow; if it be not now, yet it will come. The\nreadiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves\nknows, what is 't to leave betimes? Let be.\n\n[A table prepared. Enter Trumpets, Drums, and Officers\nwith cushions, King, Queen, Osric, and all the state,\nfoils, daggers, flagons of wine, and Laertes.]\n\n\nKING\nCome, Hamlet, come and take this hand from me.\n[He puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]\n\nHAMLET, [to Laertes]\nGive me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;\nBut pardon 't as you are a gentleman. This presence\nknows,\nAnd you must needs have heard, how I am punished\nWith a sore distraction. What I have done\nThat might your nature, honor, and exception\nRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\nWas 't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet.\nIf Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,\nAnd when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,\nThen Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.\nWho does it, then? His madness. If 't be so,\nHamlet is of the faction that is wronged;\nHis madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.\nSir, in this audience\nLet my disclaiming from a purposed evil\nFree me so far in your most generous thoughts\nThat I have shot my arrow o'er the house\nAnd hurt my brother.\n\nLAERTES  I am satisfied in nature,\nWhose motive in this case should stir me most\nTo my revenge; but in my terms of honor\nI stand aloof and will no reconcilement\nTill by some elder masters of known honor\nI have a voice and precedent of peace\nTo keep my name ungored. But till that time\nI do receive your offered love like love\nAnd will not wrong it.\n\nHAMLET  I embrace it freely\nAnd will this brothers' wager frankly play.--\nGive us the foils. Come on.\n\nLAERTES  Come, one for me.\n\nHAMLET\nI'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance\nYour skill shall, like a star i' th' darkest night,\nStick fiery off indeed.\n\nLAERTES  You mock me, sir.\n\nHAMLET  No, by this hand.\n\nKING\nGive them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,\nYou know the wager?\n\nHAMLET  Very well, my lord.\nYour Grace has laid the odds o' th' weaker side.\n\nKING\nI do not fear it; I have seen you both.\nBut, since he is better, we have therefore odds.\n\nLAERTES\nThis is too heavy. Let me see another.\n\nHAMLET\nThis likes me well. These foils have all a length?\n\nOSRIC  Ay, my good lord.\n[Prepare to play.]\n\nKING\nSet me the stoups of wine upon that table.--\nIf Hamlet give the first or second hit\nOr quit in answer of the third exchange,\nLet all the battlements their ordnance fire.\nThe King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,\nAnd in the cup an union shall he throw,\nRicher than that which four successive kings\nIn Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups,\nAnd let the kettle to the trumpet speak,\nThe trumpet to the cannoneer without,\nThe cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,\n\"Now the King drinks to Hamlet.\" Come, begin.\nAnd you, the judges, bear a wary eye.\n[Trumpets the while.]\n\nHAMLET  Come on, sir.\n\nLAERTES  Come, my lord.\t[They play.]\n\nHAMLET  One.\n\nLAERTES  No.\n\nHAMLET  Judgment!\n\nOSRIC  A hit, a very palpable hit.\n\nLAERTES  Well, again.\n\nKING\nStay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine.\nHere's to thy health.\n[He drinks and then drops the pearl in the cup.]\n[Drum, trumpets, and shot.]\nGive him the cup.\n\nHAMLET\nI'll play this bout first. Set it by awhile.\nCome. [They play.] Another hit. What say you?\n\nLAERTES\nA touch, a touch.

It is too late.\n\nHAMLET\nI dare not drink yet, madam--by and by.\n\nQUEEN  Come, let me wipe thy face.\n\nLAERTES, [to Claudius]\nMy lord, I'll hit him now.\n\nKING  I do not think 't.\n\nLAERTES, [aside]\nAnd yet it is almost against my conscience.\n\nHAMLET\nCome, for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.\nI pray you pass with your best violence.\nI am afeard you make a wanton of me.\n\nLAERTES  Say you so? Come on.\t[Play.]\n\nOSRIC  Nothing neither way.\n\nLAERTES  Have at you now!\n[Laertes wounds Hamlet. Then in scuffling they change\nrapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]\n\nKING  Part them. They are incensed.\n\nHAMLET  Nay, come again.\n[The Queen falls.]\n\nOSRIC  Look to the Queen there, ho!\n\nHORATIO\nThey bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?\n\nOSRIC  How is 't, Laertes?\n\nLAERTES\nWhy as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.\n[He falls.]\nI am justly killed with mine own treachery.\n\nHAMLET\nHow does the Queen?\n\nKING  She swoons to see them bleed.\n\nQUEEN\nNo, no, the drink, the drink! O, my dear Hamlet!\nThe drink, the drink! I am poisoned.\t[She dies.]\n\nHAMLET\nO villainy! Ho! Let the door be locked.\t[Osric exits.]\nTreachery! Seek it out.\n\nLAERTES\nIt is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.\nNo med'cine in the world can do thee good.\nIn thee there is not half an hour's life.\nThe treacherous instrument is in thy hand,\nUnbated and envenomed. The foul practice\nHath turned itself on me. Lo, here I lie,\nNever to rise again. Thy mother's poisoned.\nI can no more. The King, the King's to blame.\n\nHAMLET\nThe point envenomed too! Then, venom, to thy\nwork.\t[Hurts the King.]\n\nALL  Treason, treason!\n\nKING\nO, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.\n\nHAMLET\nHere, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,\nDrink off this potion. Is thy union here?\n[Forcing him to drink the poison.]\nFollow my mother.\t[King dies.]\n\nLAERTES  He is justly served.\nIt is a poison tempered by himself.\nExchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.\nMine and my father's death come not upon thee,\nNor thine on me.\t[Dies.]\n\nHAMLET\nHeaven make thee free of it. I follow thee.--\nI am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu.--\nYou that look pale and tremble at this chance,\nThat are but mutes or audience to this act,\nHad I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,\nIs strict in his arrest), O, I could tell you--\nBut let it be.--Horatio, I am dead.\nThou livest; report me and my cause aright\nTo the unsatisfied.\n\nHORATIO  Never believe it.\nI am more an antique Roman than a Dane.\nHere's yet some liquor left.\t[He picks up the cup.]\n\nHAMLET  As thou 'rt a man,\nGive me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha 't.\nO God, Horatio, what a wounded name,\nThings standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind\nme!\nIf thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,\nAbsent thee from felicity awhile\nAnd in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain\nTo tell my story.\n[A march afar off and shot within.]\nWhat warlike noise is this?\n\n[Enter Osric.]\n\n\nOSRIC\nYoung Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,\nTo th' ambassadors of England gives\nThis warlike volley.\n\nHAMLET  O, I die, Horatio!\nThe potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.\nI cannot live to hear the news from England.\nBut I do prophesy th' election lights\nOn Fortinbras; he has my dying voice.\nSo tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,\nWhich have solicited--the rest is silence.\nO, O, O, O!\t[Dies.]\n\nHORATIO\nNow cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,\nAnd flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\n[March within.]\nWhy does the drum come hither?\n\n[Enter Fortinbras with the English Ambassadors with\nDrum, Colors, and Attendants.]\n\n\nFORTINBRAS  Where is this sight?\n\nHORATIO  What is it you would see?\nIf aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.\n\nFORTINBRAS\nThis quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,\nWhat feast is toward in thine eternal cell\nThat thou so many princes at a shot\nSo bloodily hast struck?\n\nAMBASSADOR  The sight is dismal,\nAnd our affairs from England come too late.\nThe ears are senseless that should give us hearing\nTo tell him his commandment is fulfilled,\nThat Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\nWhere should we have our thanks?\n\nHORATIO  Not from his\nmouth,\nHad it th' ability of life to thank you.\nHe never gave commandment for their death.\nBut since, so jump upon this bloody question,\nYou from the Polack wars, and you from England,\nAre here arrived, give order that these bodies\nHigh on a stage be placed to the view,\nAnd let me speak to th' yet unknowing world\nHow these things came about. So shall you hear\nOf carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,\nOf accidental judgments, casual slaughters,\nOf deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,\nAnd, in this upshot, purposes mistook\nFall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I\nTruly deliver.\n\nFORTINBRAS  Let us haste to hear it\nAnd call the noblest to the audience.\nFor me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.\nI have some rights of memory in this kingdom,\nWhich now to claim my vantage doth invite me.\n\nHORATIO\nOf that I shall have also cause to speak,\nAnd from his mouth whose voice will draw on\nmore.\nBut let this same be presently performed\nEven while men's minds are wild, lest more\nmischance\nOn plots and errors happen.\n\nFORTINBRAS  Let four captains\nBear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,\nFor he was likely, had he been put on,\nTo have proved most royal; and for his passage,\nThe soldier's music and the rite of war\nSpeak loudly for him.\nTake up the bodies. Such a sight as this\nBecomes the field but here shows much amiss.\nGo, bid the soldiers shoot.\n[They exit, marching, after the which, a peal of\nordnance are shot off.]\n",

He can report,\nAs seemeth by his plight, of the revolt\nThe newest state.\n\nMALCOLM  This is the sergeant\nWho, like a good and hardy soldier, fought\n'Gainst my captivity.--Hail, brave friend!\nSay to the King the knowledge of the broil\nAs thou didst leave it.\n\nCAPTAIN  Doubtful it stood,\nAs two spent swimmers that do cling together\nAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald\n(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\nThe multiplying villainies of nature\nDo swarm upon him) from the Western Isles\nOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\nAnd Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\nShowed like a rebel's whore. But all's too weak;\nFor brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),\nDisdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,\nWhich smoked with bloody execution,\nLike Valor's minion, carved out his passage\nTill he faced the slave;\nWhich ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\nTill he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops,\nAnd fixed his head upon our battlements.\n\nDUNCAN\nO valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!\n\nCAPTAIN\nAs whence the sun 'gins his reflection\nShipwracking storms and direful thunders break,\nSo from that spring whence comfort seemed to\ncome\nDiscomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:\nNo sooner justice had, with valor armed,\nCompelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\nBut the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,\nWith furbished arms and new supplies of men,\nBegan a fresh assault.\n\nDUNCAN\nDismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and\nBanquo?\n\nCAPTAIN\nYes, as sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\nIf I say sooth, I must report they were\nAs cannons overcharged with double cracks,\nSo they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.\nExcept they meant to bathe in reeking wounds\nOr memorize another Golgotha,\nI cannot tell--\nBut I am faint. My gashes cry for help.\n\nDUNCAN\nSo well thy words become thee as thy wounds:\nThey smack of honor both.--Go, get him surgeons.\n[The Captain is led off by Attendants.]\n\n[Enter Ross and Angus.]\n\nWho comes here?\n\nMALCOLM  The worthy Thane of Ross.\n\nLENNOX\nWhat a haste looks through his eyes!\nSo should he look that seems to speak things\nstrange.\n\nROSS  God save the King.\n\nDUNCAN  Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?\n\nROSS  From Fife, great king,\nWhere the Norweyan banners flout the sky\nAnd fan our people cold.\nNorway himself, with terrible numbers,\nAssisted by that most disloyal traitor,\nThe Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,\nTill that Bellona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,\nConfronted him with self-comparisons,\nPoint against point, rebellious arm 'gainst arm,\nCurbing his lavish spirit. And to conclude,\nThe victory fell on us.\n\nDUNCAN  Great happiness!\n\nROSS  That now Sweno,\nThe Norways' king, craves composition.\nNor would we deign him burial of his men\nTill he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch\nTen thousand dollars to our general use.\n\nDUNCAN\nNo more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive\nOur bosom interest.

Enter the three Witches.]\n\n\nFIRST WITCH  Where hast thou been, sister?\n\nSECOND WITCH  Killing swine.\n\nTHIRD WITCH  Sister, where thou?\n\nFIRST WITCH\nA sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap\nAnd munched and munched and munched. \"Give\nme,\" quoth I.\n\"Aroint thee, witch,\" the rump-fed runnion cries.\nHer husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' th' Tiger;\nBut in a sieve I'll thither sail,\nAnd, like a rat without a tail,\nI'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.\n\nSECOND WITCH\nI'll give thee a wind.\n\nFIRST WITCH\nTh' art kind.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nAnd I another.\n\nFIRST WITCH\nI myself have all the other,\nAnd the very ports they blow;\nAll the quarters that they know\nI' th' shipman's card.\nI'll drain him dry as hay.\nSleep shall neither night nor day\nHang upon his penthouse lid.\nHe shall live a man forbid.\nWeary sev'nnights, nine times nine,\nShall he dwindle, peak, and pine.\nThough his bark cannot be lost,\nYet it shall be tempest-tossed.\nLook what I have.\n\nSECOND WITCH  Show me, show me.\n\nFIRST WITCH\nHere I have a pilot's thumb,\nWracked as homeward he did come.\t[Drum within.]\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nA drum, a drum!\nMacbeth doth come.\n\nALL, [dancing in a circle]\nThe Weird Sisters, hand in hand,\nPosters of the sea and land,\nThus do go about, about,\nThrice to thine and thrice to mine\nAnd thrice again, to make up nine.\nPeace, the charm's wound up.\n\n[Enter Macbeth and Banquo.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nSo foul and fair a day I have not seen.\n\nBANQUO\nHow far is 't called to Forres?--What are these,\nSo withered, and so wild in their attire,\nThat look not like th' inhabitants o' th' Earth\nAnd yet are on 't?--Live you? Or are you aught\nThat man may question? You seem to understand\nme\nBy each at once her choppy finger laying\nUpon her skinny lips. You should be women,\nAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpret\nThat you are so.\n\nMACBETH  Speak if you can. What are you?\n\nFIRST WITCH\nAll hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\n\nSECOND WITCH\nAll hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nAll hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!\n\nBANQUO\nGood sir, why do you start and seem to fear\nThings that do sound so fair?--I' th' name of truth,\nAre you fantastical, or that indeed\nWhich outwardly you show? My noble partner\nYou greet with present grace and great prediction\nOf noble having and of royal hope,\nThat he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.\nIf you can look into the seeds of time\nAnd say which grain will grow and which will not,\nSpeak, then, to me, who neither beg nor fear\nYour favors nor your hate.\n\nFIRST WITCH  Hail!\n\nSECOND WITCH  Hail!\n\nTHIRD WITCH  Hail!\n\nFIRST WITCH\nLesser than Macbeth and greater.\n\nSECOND WITCH\nNot so happy, yet much happier.\n\nTHIRD WITCH\nThou shalt get kings, though thou be none.\nSo all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\n\nFIRST WITCH\nBanquo and Macbeth, all hail!\n\nMACBETH\nStay, you imperfect speakers. Tell me more.\nBy Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glamis.\nBut how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives\nA prosperous gentleman, and to be king\nStands not within the prospect of belief,\nNo more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\nYou owe this strange intelligence or why\nUpon this blasted heath you stop our way\nWith such prophetic greeting. Speak, I charge you.\n[Witches vanish.]\n\nBANQUO\nThe earth hath bubbles, as the water has,\nAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanished?\n\nMACBETH\nInto the air, and what seemed corporal melted,\nAs breath into the wind. Would they had stayed!\n\nBANQUO\nWere such things here as we do speak about?\nOr have we eaten on the insane root\nThat takes the reason prisoner?\n\nMACBETH\nYour children shall be kings.\n\nBANQUO  You shall be king.\n\nMACBETH\nAnd Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?\n\nBANQUO\nTo th' selfsame tune and words.--Who's here?\n\n[Enter Ross and Angus.]\n\n\nROSS\nThe King hath happily received, Macbeth,\nThe news of thy success, and, when he reads\nThy personal venture in the rebels' fight,\nHis wonders and his praises do contend\nWhich should be thine or his. Silenced with that,\nIn viewing o'er the rest o' th' selfsame day\nHe finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\nNothing afeard of what thyself didst make,\nStrange images of death. As thick as tale\nCame post with post, and every one did bear\nThy praises in his kingdom's great defense,\nAnd poured them down before him.\n\nANGUS  We are sent\nTo give thee from our royal master thanks,\nOnly to herald thee into his sight,\nNot pay thee.\n\nROSS\nAnd for an earnest of a greater honor,\nHe bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor,\nIn which addition, hail, most worthy thane,\nFor it is thine.\n\nBANQUO  What, can the devil speak true?\n\nMACBETH\nThe Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me\nIn borrowed robes?\n\nANGUS  Who was the Thane lives yet,\nBut under heavy judgment bears that life\nWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was\ncombined\nWith those of Norway, or did line the rebel\nWith hidden help and vantage, or that with both\nHe labored in his country's wrack, I know not;\nBut treasons capital, confessed and proved,\nHave overthrown him.\n\nMACBETH, [aside]  Glamis and Thane of Cawdor!\nThe greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus.] Thanks\nfor your pains.\n[Aside to Banquo.] Do you not hope your children\nshall be kings,\nWhen those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\nPromised no less to them?\n\nBANQUO  That, trusted home,\nMight yet enkindle you unto the crown,\nBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange.\nAnd oftentimes, to win us to our harm,\nThe instruments of darkness tell us truths,\nWin us with honest trifles, to betray 's\nIn deepest consequence.--\nCousins, a word, I pray you.\t[They step aside.]\n\nMACBETH, [aside]  Two truths are told\nAs happy prologues to the swelling act\nOf the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.\n[Aside.] This supernatural soliciting\nCannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,\nWhy hath it given me earnest of success\nCommencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\nIf good, why do I yield to that suggestion\nWhose horrid image doth unfix my hair\nAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribs\nAgainst the use of nature? Present fears\nAre less than horrible imaginings.\nMy thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,\nShakes so my single state of man\nThat function is smothered in surmise,\nAnd nothing is but what is not.\n\nBANQUO  Look how our partner's rapt.\n\nMACBETH, [aside]\nIf chance will have me king, why, chance may\ncrown me\nWithout my stir.\n\nBANQUO  New honors come upon him,\nLike our strange garments, cleave not to their mold\nBut with the aid of use.\n\nMACBETH, [aside]  Come what come may,\nTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.\n\nBANQUO\nWorthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\n\nMACBETH\nGive me your favor. My dull brain was wrought\nWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\nAre registered where every day I turn\nThe leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.\n[Aside to Banquo.] Think upon what hath chanced,\nand at more time,\nThe interim having weighed it, let us speak\nOur free hearts each to other.\n\nBANQUO  Very gladly.\n\nMACBETH  Till then, enough.--Come, friends.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Flourish. Enter King Duncan, Lennox, Malcolm,\nDonalbain, and Attendants.]\n\n\nDUNCAN\nIs execution done on Cawdor? Are not\nThose in commission yet returned?\n\nMALCOLM  My liege,\nThey are not yet come back. But I have spoke\nWith one that saw him die, who did report\nThat very frankly he confessed his treasons,\nImplored your Highness' pardon, and set forth\nA deep repentance. Nothing in his life\nBecame him like the leaving it. He died\nAs one that had been studied in his death\nTo throw away the dearest thing he owed\nAs 'twere a careless trifle.\n\nDUNCAN  There's no art\nTo find the mind's construction in the face.\nHe was a gentleman on whom I built\nAn absolute trust.\n\n[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.]\n\nO worthiest cousin,\nThe sin of my ingratitude even now\nWas heavy on me. Thou art so far before\nThat swiftest wing of recompense is slow\nTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,\nThat the proportion both of thanks and payment\nMight have been mine! Only I have left to say,\nMore is thy due than more than all can pay.\n\nMACBETH\nThe service and the loyalty I owe\nIn doing it pays itself. Your Highness' part\nIs to receive our duties, and our duties\nAre to your throne and state children and servants,\nWhich do but what they should by doing everything\nSafe toward your love and honor.\n\nDUNCAN  Welcome hither.\nI have begun to plant thee and will labor\nTo make thee full of growing.--Noble Banquo,\nThat hast no less deserved nor must be known\nNo less to have done so, let me enfold thee\nAnd hold thee to my heart.\n\nBANQUO  There, if I grow,\nThe harvest is your own.\n\nDUNCAN  My plenteous joys,\nWanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves\nIn drops of sorrow.--Sons, kinsmen, thanes,\nAnd you whose places are the nearest, know\nWe will establish our estate upon\nOur eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter\nThe Prince of Cumberland; which honor must\nNot unaccompanied invest him only,\nBut signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine\nOn all deservers.--From hence to Inverness\nAnd bind us further to you.\n\nMACBETH\nThe rest is labor which is not used for you.\nI'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful\nThe hearing of my wife with your approach.\nSo humbly take my leave.\n\nDUNCAN  My worthy Cawdor.\n\nMACBETH, [aside]\nThe Prince of Cumberland! That is a step\nOn which I must fall down or else o'erleap,\nFor in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;\nLet not light see my black and deep desires.\nThe eye wink at the hand, yet let that be\nWhich the eye fears, when it is done, to see.\n[He exits.]\n\nDUNCAN\nTrue, worthy Banquo. He is full so valiant,\nAnd in his commendations I am fed:\nIt is a banquet to me.--Let's after him,\nWhose care is gone before to bid us welcome.\nIt is a peerless kinsman.\n[Flourish. They exit.]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n[Enter Macbeth's Wife, alone, with a letter.]\n\n\nLADY MACBETH, [reading the letter]  They met me in the\nday of success, and I have learned by the perfect'st\nreport they have more in them than mortal knowledge.\nWhen I burned in desire to question them further, they\nmade themselves air, into which they vanished.\nWhiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives\nfrom the King, who all-hailed me \"Thane of Cawdor,\"\nby which title, before, these Weird Sisters saluted me\nand referred me to the coming on of time with \"Hail,\nking that shalt be.\" This have I thought good to deliver\nthee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou\nmight'st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant\nof what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy\nheart, and farewell.\nGlamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be\nWhat thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature;\nIt is too full o' th' milk of human kindness\nTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great,\nArt not without ambition, but without\nThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst\nhighly,\nThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false\nAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou 'dst have, great\nGlamis,\nThat which cries \"Thus thou must do,\" if thou have\nit,\nAnd that which rather thou dost fear to do,\nThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,\nThat I may pour my spirits in thine ear\nAnd chastise with the valor of my tongue\nAll that impedes thee from the golden round,\nWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\nTo have thee crowned withal.\n\n[Enter Messenger.]\n\nWhat is your tidings?\n\nMESSENGER\nThe King comes here tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Thou 'rt mad to say it.\nIs not thy master with him, who, were 't so,\nWould have informed for preparation?\n\nMESSENGER\nSo please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.\nOne of my fellows had the speed of him,\nWho, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\nThan would make up his message.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Give him tending.\nHe brings great news.\t[Messenger exits.]\nThe raven himself is hoarse\nThat croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan\nUnder my battlements. Come, you spirits\nThat tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,\nAnd fill me from the crown to the toe top-full\nOf direst cruelty. Make thick my blood.\nStop up th' access and passage to remorse,\nThat no compunctious visitings of nature\nShake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between\nTh' effect and it. Come to my woman's breasts\nAnd take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers,\nWherever in your sightless substances\nYou wait on nature's mischief. Come, thick night,\nAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,\nThat my keen knife see not the wound it makes,\nNor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark\nTo cry \"Hold, hold!\"\n\n[Enter Macbeth.]\n\nGreat Glamis, worthy Cawdor,\nGreater than both by the all-hail hereafter!\nThy letters have transported me beyond\nThis ignorant present, and I feel now\nThe future in the instant.\n\nMACBETH  My dearest love,\nDuncan comes here tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH  And when goes hence?\n\nMACBETH\nTomorrow, as he purposes.\n\nLADY MACBETH  O, never\nShall sun that morrow see!\nYour face, my thane, is as a book where men\nMay read strange matters. To beguile the time,\nLook like the time. Bear welcome in your eye,\nYour hand, your tongue. Look like th' innocent\nflower,\nBut be the serpent under 't. He that's coming\nMust be provided for; and you shall put\nThis night's great business into my dispatch,\nWhich shall to all our nights and days to come\nGive solely sovereign sway and masterdom.\n\nMACBETH\nWe will speak further.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Only look up clear.\nTo alter favor ever is to fear.\nLeave all the rest to me.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 6\n=======\n[Hautboys and Torches. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm,\nDonalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross, Angus, and\nAttendants.]\n\n\nDUNCAN\nThis castle hath a pleasant seat. The air\nNimbly and sweetly recommends itself\nUnto our gentle senses.\n\nBANQUO  This guest of summer,\nThe temple-haunting martlet, does approve,\nBy his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath\nSmells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,\nButtress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird\nHath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.\nWhere they most breed and haunt, I have\nobserved,\nThe air is delicate.\n\n[Enter Lady Macbeth.]\n\n\nDUNCAN  See, see our honored hostess!--\nThe love that follows us sometime is our trouble,\nWhich still we thank as love. Herein I teach you\nHow you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains\nAnd thank us for your trouble.\n\nLADY MACBETH  All our service,\nIn every point twice done and then done double,\nWere poor and single business to contend\nAgainst those honors deep and broad wherewith\nYour Majesty loads our house. For those of old,\nAnd the late dignities heaped up to them,\nWe rest your hermits.\n\nDUNCAN  Where's the Thane of Cawdor?\nWe coursed him at the heels and had a purpose\nTo be his purveyor; but he rides well,\nAnd his great love, sharp as his spur, hath helped\nhim\nTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,\nWe are your guest tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Your servants ever\nHave theirs, themselves, and what is theirs in compt\nTo make their audit at your Highness' pleasure,\nStill to return your own.\n\nDUNCAN  Give me your hand.\n\n[Taking her hand.]\nConduct me to mine host. We love him highly\nAnd shall continue our graces towards him.\nBy your leave, hostess.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 7\n=======\n[Hautboys. Torches. Enter a Sewer and divers Servants\nwith dishes and service over the stage. Then enter\nMacbeth.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nIf it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well\nIt were done quickly. If th' assassination\nCould trammel up the consequence and catch\nWith his surcease success, that but this blow\nMight be the be-all and the end-all here,\nBut here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\nWe'd jump the life to come. But in these cases\nWe still have judgment here, that we but teach\nBloody instructions, which, being taught, return\nTo plague th' inventor. This even-handed justice\nCommends th' ingredience of our poisoned chalice\nTo our own lips. He's here in double trust:\nFirst, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\nStrong both against the deed; then, as his host,\nWho should against his murderer shut the door,\nNot bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\nHath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\nSo clear in his great office, that his virtues\nWill plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against\nThe deep damnation of his taking-off;\nAnd pity, like a naked newborn babe\nStriding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed\nUpon the sightless couriers of the air,\nShall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\nThat tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur\nTo prick the sides of my intent, but only\nVaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself\nAnd falls on th' other--\n\n[Enter Lady Macbeth.]\n\nHow now, what news?\n\nLADY MACBETH\nHe has almost supped. Why have you left the\nchamber?\n\nMACBETH\nHath he asked for me?\n\nLADY MACBETH  Know you not he has?\n\nMACBETH\nWe will proceed no further in this business.\nHe hath honored me of late, and I have bought\nGolden opinions from all sorts of people,\nWhich would be worn now in their newest gloss,\nNot cast aside so soon.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Was the hope drunk\nWherein you dressed yourself? Hath it slept since?\nAnd wakes it now, to look so green and pale\nAt what it did so freely? From this time\nSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeard\nTo be the same in thine own act and valor\nAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\nWhich thou esteem'st the ornament of life\nAnd live a coward in thine own esteem,\nLetting \"I dare not\" wait upon \"I would,\"\nLike the poor cat i' th' adage?\n\nMACBETH  Prithee, peace.\nI dare do all that may become a man.\nWho dares do more is none.\n\nLADY MACBETH  What beast was 't,\nthen,\nThat made you break this enterprise to me?\nWhen you durst do it, then you were a man;\nAnd to be more than what you were, you would\nBe so much more the man. Nor time nor place\nDid then adhere, and yet you would make both.\nThey have made themselves, and that their fitness\nnow\nDoes unmake you. I have given suck, and know\nHow tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me.\nI would, while it was smiling in my face,\nHave plucked my nipple from his boneless gums\nAnd dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you\nHave done to this.\n\nMACBETH  If we should fail--\n\nLADY MACBETH  We fail?\nBut screw your courage to the sticking place\nAnd we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep\n(Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey\nSoundly invite him), his two chamberlains\nWill I with wine and wassail so convince\nThat memory, the warder of the brain,\nShall be a fume, and the receipt of reason\nA limbeck only. When in swinish sleep\nTheir drenched natures lies as in a death,\nWhat cannot you and I perform upon\nTh' unguarded Duncan? What not put upon\nHis spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt\nOf our great quell?\n\nMACBETH  Bring forth men-children only,\nFor thy undaunted mettle should compose\nNothing but males. Will it not be received,\nWhen we have marked with blood those sleepy two\nOf his own chamber and used their very daggers,\nThat they have done 't?\n\nLADY MACBETH  Who dares receive it other,\nAs we shall make our griefs and clamor roar\nUpon his death?\n\nMACBETH  I am settled and bend up\nEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.\nAway, and mock the time with fairest show.\nFalse face must hide what the false heart doth\nknow.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 2\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch before him.]\n\n\nBANQUO  How goes the night, boy?\n\nFLEANCE\nThe moon is down. I have not heard the clock.\n\nBANQUO  And she goes down at twelve.\n\nFLEANCE  I take 't 'tis later, sir.\n\nBANQUO\nHold, take my sword.\t[He gives his sword to Fleance.]\nThere's husbandry in heaven;\nTheir candles are all out. Take thee that too.\nA heavy summons lies like lead upon me,\nAnd yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,\nRestrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature\nGives way to in repose.\n\n[Enter Macbeth, and a Servant with a torch.]\n\nGive me my sword.--Who's\nthere?\n\nMACBETH  A friend.\n\nBANQUO\nWhat, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed.\nHe hath been in unusual pleasure, and\nSent forth great largess to your offices.\nThis diamond he greets your wife withal,\nBy the name of most kind hostess, and shut up\nIn measureless content.\n[He gives Macbeth a jewel.]\n\nMACBETH  Being unprepared,\nOur will became the servant to defect,\nWhich else should free have wrought.\n\nBANQUO  All's well.\nI dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters.\nTo you they have showed some truth.\n\nMACBETH  I think not of\nthem.\nYet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\nWe would spend it in some words upon that\nbusiness,\nIf you would grant the time.\n\nBANQUO  At your kind'st leisure.\n\nMACBETH\nIf you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,\nIt shall make honor for you.\n\nBANQUO  So I lose none\nIn seeking to augment it, but still keep\nMy bosom franchised and allegiance clear,\nI shall be counseled.\n\nMACBETH  Good repose the while.\n\nBANQUO  Thanks, sir. The like to you.\n[Banquo and Fleance exit.]\n\nMACBETH\nGo bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\nShe strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.\n[Servant exits.]\nIs this a dagger which I see before me,\nThe handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch\nthee.\nI have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\nArt thou not, fatal vision, sensible\nTo feeling as to sight? Or art thou but\nA dagger of the mind, a false creation\nProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\nI see thee yet, in form as palpable\nAs this which now I draw.\t[He draws his dagger.]\nThou marshal'st me the way that I was going,\nAnd such an instrument I was to use.\nMine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses\nOr else worth all the rest. I see thee still,\nAnd, on thy blade and dudgeon, gouts of blood,\nWhich was not so before. There's no such thing.\nIt is the bloody business which informs\nThus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one-half world\nNature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\nThe curtained sleep. Witchcraft celebrates\nPale Hecate's off'rings, and withered murder,\nAlarumed by his sentinel, the wolf,\nWhose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\nWith Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his\ndesign\nMoves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,\nHear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\nThy very stones prate of my whereabouts\nAnd take the present horror from the time,\nWhich now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives.\nWords to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\n[A bell rings.]\nI go, and it is done. The bell invites me.\nHear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell\nThat summons thee to heaven or to hell.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Lady Macbeth.]\n\n\nLADY MACBETH\nThat which hath made them drunk hath made me\nbold.\nWhat hath quenched them hath given me fire.\nHark!--Peace.\nIt was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman,\nWhich gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it.\nThe doors are open, and the surfeited grooms\nDo mock their charge with snores. I have drugged\ntheir possets,\nThat death and nature do contend about them\nWhether they live or die.\n\nMACBETH, [within]  Who's there? what, ho!\n\nLADY MACBETH\nAlack, I am afraid they have awaked,\nAnd 'tis not done. Th' attempt and not the deed\nConfounds us. Hark!--I laid their daggers ready;\nHe could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled\nMy father as he slept, I had done 't.\n\n[Enter Macbeth with bloody daggers.]\n\nMy husband?\n\nMACBETH\nI have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?\n\nLADY MACBETH\nI heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.\nDid not you speak?\n\nMACBETH  When?\n\nLADY MACBETH  Now.\n\nMACBETH  As I descended?\n\nLADY MACBETH  Ay.\n\nMACBETH  Hark!--Who lies i' th' second chamber?\n\nLADY MACBETH  Donalbain.\n\nMACBETH  This is a sorry sight.\n\nLADY MACBETH\nA foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.\n\nMACBETH\nThere's one did laugh in 's sleep, and one cried\n\"Murder!\"\nThat they did wake each other. I stood and heard\nthem.\nBut they did say their prayers and addressed them\nAgain to sleep.\n\nLADY MACBETH  There are two lodged together.\n\nMACBETH\nOne cried \"God bless us\" and \"Amen\" the other,\nAs they had seen me with these hangman's hands,\nList'ning their fear. I could not say \"Amen\"\nWhen they did say \"God bless us.\"\n\nLADY MACBETH  Consider it not so deeply.\n\nMACBETH\nBut wherefore could not I pronounce \"Amen\"?\nI had most need of blessing, and \"Amen\"\nStuck in my throat.\n\nLADY MACBETH  These deeds must not be thought\nAfter these ways; so, it will make us mad.\n\nMACBETH\nMethought I heard a voice cry \"Sleep no more!\nMacbeth does murder sleep\"--the innocent sleep,\nSleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care,\nThe death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,\nBalm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,\nChief nourisher in life's feast.\n\nLADY MACBETH  What do you mean?\n\nMACBETH\nStill it cried \"Sleep no more!\" to all the house.\n\"Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore\nCawdor\nShall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more.\"\n\nLADY MACBETH\nWho was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,\nYou do unbend your noble strength to think\nSo brainsickly of things. Go get some water\nAnd wash this filthy witness from your hand.--\nWhy did you bring these daggers from the place?\nThey must lie there. Go, carry them and smear\nThe sleepy grooms with blood.\n\nMACBETH  I'll go no more.\nI am afraid to think what I have done.\nLook on 't again I dare not.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Infirm of purpose!\nGive me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead\nAre but as pictures. 'Tis the eye of childhood\nThat fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,\nI'll gild the faces of the grooms withal,\nFor it must seem their guilt.\n[She exits with the daggers. Knock within.]\n\nMACBETH  Whence is that\nknocking?\nHow is 't with me when every noise appalls me?\nWhat hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.\nWill all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood\nClean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather\nThe multitudinous seas incarnadine,\nMaking the green one red.\n\n[Enter Lady Macbeth.]\n\n\nLADY MACBETH\nMy hands are of your color, but I shame\nTo wear a heart so white.\t[Knock.]\nI hear a knocking\nAt the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.\nA little water clears us of this deed.\nHow easy is it, then! Your constancy\nHath left you unattended.\t[Knock.]\nHark, more knocking.\nGet on your nightgown, lest occasion call us\nAnd show us to be watchers. Be not lost\nSo poorly in your thoughts.\n\nMACBETH\nTo know my deed 'twere best not know myself.\n[Knock.]\nWake Duncan with thy knocking. I would thou\ncouldst.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Knocking within. Enter a Porter.]\n\n\nPORTER  Here's a knocking indeed! If a man were\nporter of hell gate, he should have old turning the\nkey. [(Knock.)] Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i'\nth' name of Beelzebub? Here's a farmer that hanged\nhimself on th' expectation of plenty. Come in time!\nHave napkins enough about you; here you'll sweat\nfor 't. [(Knock.)] Knock, knock! Who's there, in th'\nother devil's name? Faith, here's an equivocator\nthat could swear in both the scales against either\nscale, who committed treason enough for God's\nsake yet could not equivocate to heaven. O, come in,\nequivocator. [(Knock.)] Knock, knock, knock! Who's\nthere? Faith, here's an English tailor come hither for\nstealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor. Here\nyou may roast your goose. [(Knock.)] Knock, knock!\nNever at quiet.--What are you?--But this place is\ntoo cold for hell. I'll devil-porter it no further. I had\nthought to have let in some of all professions that go\nthe primrose way to th' everlasting bonfire. [(Knock.)]\nAnon, anon!\n\n[The Porter opens the door to Macduff and Lennox.]\n\nI pray you, remember the porter.\n\nMACDUFF\nWas it so late, friend, ere you went to bed\nThat you do lie so late?\n\nPORTER  Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second\ncock, and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three\nthings.\n\nMACDUFF  What three things does drink especially\nprovoke?\n\nPORTER  Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine.\nLechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes. It provokes\nthe desire, but it takes away the performance.\nTherefore much drink may be said to be an\nequivocator with lechery. It makes him, and it\nmars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it\npersuades him and disheartens him; makes him\nstand to and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates\nhim in a sleep and, giving him the lie, leaves\nhim.\n\nMACDUFF  I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\n\nPORTER  That it did, sir, i' th' very throat on me; but I\nrequited him for his lie, and, I think, being too\nstrong for him, though he took up my legs sometime,\nyet I made a shift to cast him.\n\nMACDUFF  Is thy master stirring?\n\n[Enter Macbeth.]\n\nOur knocking has awaked him. Here he comes.\n[Porter exits.]\n\nLENNOX\nGood morrow, noble sir.\n\nMACBETH  Good morrow, both.\n\nMACDUFF\nIs the King stirring, worthy thane?\n\nMACBETH  Not yet.\n\nMACDUFF\nHe did command me to call timely on him.\nI have almost slipped the hour.\n\nMACBETH  I'll bring you to him.\n\nMACDUFF\nI know this is a joyful trouble to you,\nBut yet 'tis one.\n\nMACBETH\nThe labor we delight in physics pain.\nThis is the door.\n\nMACDUFF  I'll make so bold to call,\nFor 'tis my limited service.\t[Macduff exits.]\n\nLENNOX  Goes the King hence today?\n\nMACBETH  He does. He did appoint so.\n\nLENNOX\nThe night has been unruly. Where we lay,\nOur chimneys were blown down and, as they say,\nLamentings heard i' th' air, strange screams of\ndeath,\nAnd prophesying, with accents terrible,\nOf dire combustion and confused events\nNew hatched to th' woeful time. The obscure bird\nClamored the livelong night. Some say the Earth\nWas feverous and did shake.\n\nMACBETH  'Twas a rough night.\n\nLENNOX\nMy young remembrance cannot parallel\nA fellow to it.\n\n[Enter Macduff.]\n\n\nMACDUFF  O horror, horror, horror!\nTongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!\n\nMACBETH AND LENNOX  What's the matter?\n\nMACDUFF\nConfusion now hath made his masterpiece.\nMost sacrilegious murder hath broke ope\nThe Lord's anointed temple and stole thence\nThe life o' th' building.\n\nMACBETH  What is 't you say? The life?\n\nLENNOX  Mean you his Majesty?\n\nMACDUFF\nApproach the chamber and destroy your sight\nWith a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.\nSee and then speak yourselves.\n[Macbeth and Lennox exit.]\nAwake, awake!\nRing the alarum bell.--Murder and treason!\nBanquo and Donalbain, Malcolm, awake!\nShake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,\nAnd look on death itself. Up, up, and see\nThe great doom's image. Malcolm, Banquo,\nAs from your graves rise up and walk like sprites\nTo countenance this horror.--Ring the bell.\n[Bell rings.]\n\n[Enter Lady Macbeth.]\n\n\nLADY MACBETH  What's the business,\nThat such a hideous trumpet calls to parley\nThe sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!\n\nMACDUFF  O gentle lady,\n'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak.\nThe repetition in a woman's ear\nWould murder as it fell.\n\n[Enter Banquo.]\n\nO Banquo, Banquo,\nOur royal master's murdered.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Woe, alas!\nWhat, in our house?\n\nBANQUO  Too cruel anywhere.--\nDear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself\nAnd say it is not so.\n\n[Enter Macbeth, Lennox, and Ross.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nHad I but died an hour before this chance,\nI had lived a blessed time; for from this instant\nThere's nothing serious in mortality.\nAll is but toys. Renown and grace is dead.\nThe wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees\nIs left this vault to brag of.\n\n[Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.]\n\n\nDONALBAIN  What is amiss?\n\nMACBETH  You are, and do not know 't.\nThe spring, the head, the fountain of your blood\nIs stopped; the very source of it is stopped.\n\nMACDUFF\nYour royal father's murdered.\n\nMALCOLM  O, by whom?\n\nLENNOX\nThose of his chamber, as it seemed, had done 't.\nTheir hands and faces were all badged with blood.\nSo were their daggers, which unwiped we found\nUpon their pillows. They stared and were distracted.\nNo man's life was to be trusted with them.\n\nMACBETH\nO, yet I do repent me of my fury,\nThat I did kill them.\n\nMACDUFF  Wherefore did you so?\n\nMACBETH\nWho can be wise, amazed, temp'rate, and furious,\nLoyal, and neutral, in a moment? No man.\nTh' expedition of my violent love\nOutrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,\nHis silver skin laced with his golden blood,\nAnd his gashed stabs looked like a breach in nature\nFor ruin's wasteful entrance; there the murderers,\nSteeped in the colors of their trade, their daggers\nUnmannerly breeched with gore. Who could refrain\nThat had a heart to love, and in that heart\nCourage to make 's love known?\n\nLADY MACBETH  Help me hence, ho!\n\nMACDUFF\nLook to the lady.\n\nMALCOLM, [aside to Donalbain]  Why do we hold our\ntongues,\nThat most may claim this argument for ours?\n\nDONALBAIN, [aside to Malcolm]\nWhat should be spoken here, where our fate,\nHid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?\nLet's away. Our tears are not yet brewed.\n\nMALCOLM, [aside to Donalbain]\nNor our strong sorrow upon the foot of motion.\n\nBANQUO  Look to the lady.\n[Lady Macbeth is assisted to leave.]\nAnd when we have our naked frailties hid,\nThat suffer in exposure, let us meet\nAnd question this most bloody piece of work\nTo know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.\nIn the great hand of God I stand, and thence\nAgainst the undivulged pretense I fight\nOf treasonous malice.\n\nMACDUFF  And so do I.\n\nALL  So all.\n\nMACBETH\nLet's briefly put on manly readiness\nAnd meet i' th' hall together.\n\nALL  Well contented.\n[All but Malcolm and Donalbain exit.]\n\nMALCOLM\nWhat will you do? Let's not consort with them.\nTo show an unfelt sorrow is an office\nWhich the false man does easy. I'll to England.\n\nDONALBAIN\nTo Ireland I. Our separated fortune\nShall keep us both the safer. Where we are,\nThere's daggers in men's smiles. The near in blood,\nThe nearer bloody.\n\nMALCOLM  This murderous shaft that's shot\nHath not yet lighted, and our safest way\nIs to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse,\nAnd let us not be dainty of leave-taking\nBut shift away. There's warrant in that theft\nWhich steals itself when there's no mercy left.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Ross with an Old Man.]\n\n\nOLD MAN\nThreescore and ten I can remember well,\nWithin the volume of which time I have seen\nHours dreadful and things strange, but this sore\nnight\nHath trifled former knowings.\n\nROSS  Ha, good father,\nThou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act,\nThreatens his bloody stage. By th' clock 'tis day,\nAnd yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.\nIs 't night's predominance or the day's shame\nThat darkness does the face of earth entomb\nWhen living light should kiss it?\n\nOLD MAN  'Tis unnatural,\nEven like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last\nA falcon, tow'ring in her pride of place,\nWas by a mousing owl hawked at and killed.\n\nROSS\nAnd Duncan's horses (a thing most strange and\ncertain),\nBeauteous and swift, the minions of their race,\nTurned wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,\nContending 'gainst obedience, as they would\nMake war with mankind.\n\nOLD MAN  'Tis said they eat each\nother.\n\nROSS\nThey did so, to th' amazement of mine eyes\nThat looked upon 't.\n\n[Enter Macduff.]\n\nHere comes the good\nMacduff.--\nHow goes the world, sir, now?\n\nMACDUFF  Why, see you not?\n\nROSS\nIs 't known who did this more than bloody deed?\n\nMACDUFF\nThose that Macbeth hath slain.\n\nROSS  Alas the day,\nWhat good could they pretend?\n\nMACDUFF  They were suborned.\nMalcolm and Donalbain, the King's two sons,\nAre stol'n away and fled, which puts upon them\nSuspicion of the deed.\n\nROSS  'Gainst nature still!\nThriftless ambition, that will ravin up\nThine own lives' means. Then 'tis most like\nThe sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.\n\nMACDUFF\nHe is already named and gone to Scone\nTo be invested.\n\nROSS  Where is Duncan's body?\n\nMACDUFF  Carried to Colmekill,\nThe sacred storehouse of his predecessors\nAnd guardian of their bones.\n\nROSS  Will you to Scone?\n\nMACDUFF\nNo, cousin, I'll to Fife.\n\nROSS  Well, I will thither.\n\nMACDUFF\nWell, may you see things well done there. Adieu,\nLest our old robes sit easier than our new.\n\nROSS  Farewell, father.\n\nOLD MAN\nGod's benison go with you and with those\nThat would make good of bad and friends of foes.\n[All exit.]\n\n\nACT 3\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Banquo.]\n\n\nBANQUO\nThou hast it now--king, Cawdor, Glamis, all\nAs the Weird Women promised, and I fear\nThou played'st most foully for 't. Yet it was said\nIt should not stand in thy posterity,\nBut that myself should be the root and father\nOf many kings. If there come truth from them\n(As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)\nWhy, by the verities on thee made good,\nMay they not be my oracles as well,\nAnd set me up in hope? But hush, no more.\n\n[Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady\nMacbeth, Lennox, Ross, Lords, and Attendants.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nHere's our chief guest.\n\nLADY MACBETH  If he had been forgotten,\nIt had been as a gap in our great feast\nAnd all-thing unbecoming.\n\nMACBETH\nTonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,\nAnd I'll request your presence.\n\nBANQUO  Let your Highness\nCommand upon me, to the which my duties\nAre with a most indissoluble tie\nForever knit.\n\nMACBETH  Ride you this afternoon?\n\nBANQUO  Ay, my good lord.\n\nMACBETH\nWe should have else desired your good advice\n(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)\nIn this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.\nIs 't far you ride?\n\nBANQUO\nAs far, my lord, as will fill up the time\n'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,\nI must become a borrower of the night\nFor a dark hour or twain.\n\nMACBETH  Fail not our feast.\n\nBANQUO  My lord, I will not.\n\nMACBETH\nWe hear our bloody cousins are bestowed\nIn England and in Ireland, not confessing\nTheir cruel parricide, filling their hearers\nWith strange invention. But of that tomorrow,\nWhen therewithal we shall have cause of state\nCraving us jointly. Hie you to horse. Adieu,\nTill you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?\n\nBANQUO\nAy, my good lord. Our time does call upon 's.\n\nMACBETH\nI wish your horses swift and sure of foot,\nAnd so I do commend you to their backs.\nFarewell.\t[Banquo exits.]\nLet every man be master of his time\nTill seven at night. To make society\nThe sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself\nTill suppertime alone. While then, God be with you.\n[Lords and all but Macbeth and a Servant exit.]\nSirrah, a word with you. Attend those men\nOur pleasure?\n\nSERVANT\nThey are, my lord, without the palace gate.\n\nMACBETH\nBring them before us.\t[Servant exits.]\nTo be thus is nothing,\nBut to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo\nStick deep, and in his royalty of nature\nReigns that which would be feared. 'Tis much he\ndares,\nAnd to that dauntless temper of his mind\nHe hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor\nTo act in safety. There is none but he\nWhose being I do fear; and under him\nMy genius is rebuked, as it is said\nMark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\nWhen first they put the name of king upon me\nAnd bade them speak to him. Then, prophet-like,\nThey hailed him father to a line of kings.\nUpon my head they placed a fruitless crown\nAnd put a barren scepter in my grip,\nThence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,\nNo son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,\nFor Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;\nFor them the gracious Duncan have I murdered,\nPut rancors in the vessel of my peace\nOnly for them, and mine eternal jewel\nGiven to the common enemy of man\nTo make them kings, the seeds of Banquo kings.\nRather than so, come fate into the list,\nAnd champion me to th' utterance.--Who's there?\n\n[Enter Servant and two Murderers.]\n\n[To the Servant.] Now go to the door, and stay there\ntill we call.\t[Servant exits.]\nWas it not yesterday we spoke together?\n\nMURDERERS\nIt was, so please your Highness.\n\nMACBETH  Well then, now\nHave you considered of my speeches? Know\nThat it was he, in the times past, which held you\nSo under fortune, which you thought had been\nOur innocent self. This I made good to you\nIn our last conference, passed in probation with you\nHow you were borne in hand, how crossed, the\ninstruments,\nWho wrought with them, and all things else that\nmight\nTo half a soul and to a notion crazed\nSay \"Thus did Banquo.\"\n\nFIRST MURDERER  You made it known to us.\n\nMACBETH\nI did so, and went further, which is now\nOur point of second meeting. Do you find\nYour patience so predominant in your nature\nThat you can let this go? Are you so gospeled\nTo pray for this good man and for his issue,\nWhose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave\nAnd beggared yours forever?\n\nFIRST MURDERER  We are men, my liege.\n\nMACBETH\nAy, in the catalogue you go for men,\nAs hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels,\ncurs,\nShoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept\nAll by the name of dogs. The valued file\nDistinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\nThe housekeeper, the hunter, every one\nAccording to the gift which bounteous nature\nHath in him closed; whereby he does receive\nParticular addition, from the bill\nThat writes them all alike. And so of men.\nNow, if you have a station in the file,\nNot i' th' worst rank of manhood, say 't,\nAnd I will put that business in your bosoms\nWhose execution takes your enemy off,\nGrapples you to the heart and love of us,\nWho wear our health but sickly in his life,\nWhich in his death were perfect.\n\nSECOND MURDERER  I am one, my liege,\nWhom the vile blows and buffets of the world\nHath so incensed that I am reckless what\nI do to spite the world.\n\nFIRST MURDERER  And I another\nSo weary with disasters, tugged with fortune,\nThat I would set my life on any chance,\nTo mend it or be rid on 't.\n\nMACBETH  Both of you\nKnow Banquo was your enemy.\n\nMURDERERS  True, my lord.\n\nMACBETH\nSo is he mine, and in such bloody distance\nThat every minute of his being thrusts\nAgainst my near'st of life. And though I could\nWith barefaced power sweep him from my sight\nAnd bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\nFor certain friends that are both his and mine,\nWhose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\nWho I myself struck down. And thence it is\nThat I to your assistance do make love,\nMasking the business from the common eye\nFor sundry weighty reasons.\n\nSECOND MURDERER  We shall, my lord,\nPerform what you command us.\n\nFIRST MURDERER  Though our lives--\n\nMACBETH\nYour spirits shine through you. Within this hour at\nmost\nI will advise you where to plant yourselves,\nAcquaint you with the perfect spy o' th' time,\nThe moment on 't, for 't must be done tonight\nAnd something from the palace; always thought\nThat I require a clearness. And with him\n(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)\nFleance, his son, that keeps him company,\nWhose absence is no less material to me\nThan is his father's, must embrace the fate\nOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.\nI'll come to you anon.\n\nMURDERERS  We are resolved, my lord.\n\nMACBETH\nI'll call upon you straight. Abide within.\n[Murderers exit.]\nIt is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,\nIf it find heaven, must find it out tonight.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Macbeth's Lady and a Servant.]\n\n\nLADY MACBETH  Is Banquo gone from court?\n\nSERVANT\nAy, madam, but returns again tonight.\n\nLADY MACBETH\nSay to the King I would attend his leisure\nFor a few words.\n\nSERVANT  Madam, I will.\t[He exits.]\n\nLADY MACBETH  Naught's had, all's spent,\nWhere our desire is got without content.\n'Tis safer to be that which we destroy\nThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.\n\n[Enter Macbeth.]\n\nHow now, my lord, why do you keep alone,\nOf sorriest fancies your companions making,\nUsing those thoughts which should indeed have died\nWith them they think on? Things without all remedy\nShould be without regard. What's done is done.\n\nMACBETH\nWe have scorched the snake, not killed it.\nShe'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice\nRemains in danger of her former tooth.\nBut let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds\nsuffer,\nEre we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep\nIn the affliction of these terrible dreams\nThat shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\nWhom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\nThan on the torture of the mind to lie\nIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave.\nAfter life's fitful fever he sleeps well.\nTreason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison,\nMalice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\nCan touch him further.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Come on, gentle my lord,\nSleek o'er your rugged looks. Be bright and jovial\nAmong your guests tonight.\n\nMACBETH  So shall I, love,\nAnd so I pray be you. Let your remembrance\nApply to Banquo; present him eminence\nBoth with eye and tongue: unsafe the while that we\nMust lave our honors in these flattering streams\nAnd make our faces vizards to our hearts,\nDisguising what they are.\n\nLADY MACBETH  You must leave this.\n\nMACBETH\nO, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\nThou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.\n\nLADY MACBETH\nBut in them nature's copy's not eterne.\n\nMACBETH\nThere's comfort yet; they are assailable.\nThen be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\nHis cloistered flight, ere to black Hecate's summons\nThe shard-born beetle with his drowsy hums\nHath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done\nA deed of dreadful note.\n\nLADY MACBETH  What's to be done?\n\nMACBETH\nBe innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\nTill thou applaud the deed.--Come, seeling night,\nScarf up the tender eye of pitiful day\nAnd with thy bloody and invisible hand\nCancel and tear to pieces that great bond\nWhich keeps me pale. Light thickens, and the crow\nMakes wing to th' rooky wood.\nGood things of day begin to droop and drowse,\nWhiles night's black agents to their preys do\nrouse.--\nThou marvel'st at my words, but hold thee still.\nThings bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\nSo prithee go with me.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter three Murderers.]\n\n\nFIRST MURDERER\nBut who did bid thee join with us?\n\nTHIRD MURDERER  Macbeth.\n\nSECOND MURDERER, [to the First Murderer]\nHe needs not our mistrust, since he delivers\nOur offices and what we have to do\nTo the direction just.\n\nFIRST MURDERER  Then stand with us.--\nThe west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.\nNow spurs the lated traveler apace\nTo gain the timely inn, and near approaches\nThe subject of our watch.\n\nTHIRD MURDERER  Hark, I hear horses.\n\nBANQUO, [within]  Give us a light there, ho!\n\nSECOND MURDERER  Then 'tis he. The rest\nThat are within the note of expectation\nAlready are i' th' court.\n\nFIRST MURDERER  His horses go about.\n\nTHIRD MURDERER\nAlmost a mile; but he does usually\n(So all men do) from hence to th' palace gate\nMake it their walk.\n\n[Enter Banquo and Fleance, with a torch.]\n\n\nSECOND MURDERER  A light, a light!\n\nTHIRD MURDERER  'Tis he.\n\nFIRST MURDERER  Stand to 't.\n\nBANQUO, [to Fleance]  It will be rain tonight.\n\nFIRST MURDERER  Let it come down!\n[The three Murderers attack.]\n\nBANQUO\nO treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!\nThou mayst revenge--O slave!\n[He dies. Fleance exits.]\n\nTHIRD MURDERER\nWho did strike out the light?\n\nFIRST MURDERER  Was 't not the way?\n\nTHIRD MURDERER  There's but one down. The son is\nfled.\n\nSECOND MURDERER  We have lost best half of our\naffair.\n\nFIRST MURDERER\nWell, let's away and say how much is done.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth,\nRoss, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nYou know your own degrees; sit down. At first\nAnd last, the hearty welcome.\t[They sit.]\n\nLORDS  Thanks to your Majesty.\n\nMACBETH\nOurself will mingle with society\nAnd play the humble host.\nOur hostess keeps her state, but in best time\nWe will require her welcome.\n\nLADY MACBETH\nPronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,\nFor my heart speaks they are welcome.\n\n[Enter First Murderer to the door.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nSee, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.\nBoth sides are even. Here I'll sit i' th' midst.\nBe large in mirth. Anon we'll drink a measure\nThe table round. [He approaches the Murderer.] There's\nblood upon thy face.\n\nMURDERER  'Tis Banquo's then.\n\nMACBETH\n'Tis better thee without than he within.\nIs he dispatched?\n\nMURDERER\nMy lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.\n\nMACBETH\nThou art the best o' th' cutthroats,\nYet he's good that did the like for Fleance.\nIf thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.\n\nMURDERER\nMost royal sir, Fleance is 'scaped.\n\nMACBETH, [aside]\nThen comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,\nWhole as the marble, founded as the rock,\nAs broad and general as the casing air.\nBut now I am cabined, cribbed, confined, bound in\nTo saucy doubts and fears.--But Banquo's safe?\n\nMURDERER\nAy, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\nWith twenty trenched gashes on his head,\nThe least a death to nature.\n\nMACBETH  Thanks for that.\nThere the grown serpent lies. The worm that's fled\nHath nature that in time will venom breed,\nNo teeth for th' present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow\nWe'll hear ourselves again.\t[Murderer exits.]\n\nLADY MACBETH  My royal lord,\nYou do not give the cheer. The feast is sold\nThat is not often vouched, while 'tis a-making,\n'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;\nFrom thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony;\nMeeting were bare without it.\n\n[Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeth's place.]\n\n\nMACBETH, [to Lady Macbeth]  Sweet remembrancer!--\nNow, good digestion wait on appetite\nAnd health on both!\n\nLENNOX  May 't please your Highness sit.\n\nMACBETH\nHere had we now our country's honor roofed,\nWere the graced person of our Banquo present,\nWho may I rather challenge for unkindness\nThan pity for mischance.\n\nROSS  His absence, sir,\nLays blame upon his promise. Please 't your\nHighness\nTo grace us with your royal company?\n\nMACBETH\nThe table's full.\n\nLENNOX  Here is a place reserved, sir.\n\nMACBETH  Where?\n\nLENNOX\nHere, my good lord. What is 't that moves your\nHighness?\n\nMACBETH\nWhich of you have done this?\n\nLORDS  What, my good lord?\n\nMACBETH, [to the Ghost]\nThou canst not say I did it. Never shake\nThy gory locks at me.\n\nROSS\nGentlemen, rise. His Highness is not well.\n\nLADY MACBETH\nSit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus\nAnd hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.\nThe fit is momentary; upon a thought\nHe will again be well. If much you note him\nYou shall offend him and extend his passion.\nFeed and regard him not.\t[Drawing Macbeth aside.]\nAre you a man?\n\nMACBETH\nAy, and a bold one, that dare look on that\nWhich might appall the devil.\n\nLADY MACBETH  O, proper stuff!\nThis is the very painting of your fear.\nThis is the air-drawn dagger which you said\nLed you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,\nImpostors to true fear, would well become\nA woman's story at a winter's fire,\nAuthorized by her grandam. Shame itself!\nWhy do you make such faces? When all's done,\nYou look but on a stool.\n\nMACBETH\nPrithee, see there. Behold, look! [To the Ghost.] Lo,\nhow say you?\nWhy, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.--\nIf charnel houses and our graves must send\nThose that we bury back, our monuments\nShall be the maws of kites.\t[Ghost exits.]\n\nLADY MACBETH  What, quite unmanned in folly?\n\nMACBETH\nIf I stand here, I saw him.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Fie, for shame!\n\nMACBETH\nBlood hath been shed ere now, i' th' olden time,\nEre humane statute purged the gentle weal;\nAy, and since too, murders have been performed\nToo terrible for the ear. The time has been\nThat, when the brains were out, the man would die,\nAnd there an end. But now they rise again\nWith twenty mortal murders on their crowns\nAnd push us from our stools. This is more strange\nThan such a murder is.\n\nLADY MACBETH  My worthy lord,\nYour noble friends do lack you.\n\nMACBETH  I do forget.--\nDo not muse at me, my most worthy friends.\nI have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\nTo those that know me. Come, love and health to\nall.\nThen I'll sit down.--Give me some wine. Fill full.\n\n[Enter Ghost.]\n\nI drink to th' general joy o' th' whole table\nAnd to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.\nWould he were here! To all, and him we thirst,\nAnd all to all.\n\nLORDS  Our duties, and the pledge.\n[They raise their drinking cups.]\n\nMACBETH, [to the Ghost]\nAvaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee.\nThy bones are marrowless; thy blood is cold;\nThou hast no speculation in those eyes\nWhich thou dost glare with.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Think of this, good\npeers,\nBut as a thing of custom. 'Tis no other;\nOnly it spoils the pleasure of the time.\n\nMACBETH, [to the Ghost]  What man dare, I dare.\nApproach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\nThe armed rhinoceros, or th' Hyrcan tiger;\nTake any shape but that, and my firm nerves\nShall never tremble. Or be alive again\nAnd dare me to the desert with thy sword.\nIf trembling I inhabit then, protest me\nThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\nUnreal mock'ry, hence!\t[Ghost exits.]\nWhy so, being gone,\nI am a man again.--Pray you sit still.\n\nLADY MACBETH\nYou have displaced the mirth, broke the good\nmeeting\nWith most admired disorder.\n\nMACBETH  Can such things be\nAnd overcome us like a summer's cloud,\nWithout our special wonder? You make me strange\nEven to the disposition that I owe\nWhen now I think you can behold such sights\nAnd keep the natural ruby of your cheeks\nWhen mine is blanched with fear.\n\nROSS  What sights, my\nlord?\n\nLADY MACBETH\nI pray you, speak not. He grows worse and worse.\nQuestion enrages him. At once, good night.\nStand not upon the order of your going,\nBut go at once.\n\nLENNOX  Good night, and better health\nAttend his Majesty.\n\nLADY MACBETH  A kind good night to all.\n[Lords and all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth exit.]\n\nMACBETH\nIt will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.\nStones have been known to move, and trees to\nspeak.\nAugurs and understood relations have\nBy maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought\nforth\nThe secret'st man of blood.--What is the night?\n\nLADY MACBETH\nAlmost at odds with morning, which is which.\n\nMACBETH\nHow say'st thou that Macduff denies his person\nAt our great bidding?\n\nLADY MACBETH  Did you send to him, sir?\n\nMACBETH\nI hear it by the way; but I will send.\nThere's not a one of them but in his house\nI keep a servant fee'd. I will tomorrow\n(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters.\nMore shall they speak, for now I am bent to know\nBy the worst means the worst. For mine own good,\nAll causes shall give way. I am in blood\nStepped in so far that, should I wade no more,\nReturning were as tedious as go o'er.\nStrange things I have in head that will to hand,\nWhich must be acted ere they may be scanned.\n\nLADY MACBETH\nYou lack the season of all natures, sleep.\n\nMACBETH\nCome, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse\nIs the initiate fear that wants hard use.\nWe are yet but young in deed.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n[Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.]\n\n\nFIRST WITCH\nWhy, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.\n\nHECATE\nHave I not reason, beldams as you are?\nSaucy and overbold, how did you dare\nTo trade and traffic with Macbeth\nIn riddles and affairs of death,\nAnd I, the mistress of your charms,\nThe close contriver of all harms,\nWas never called to bear my part\nOr show the glory of our art?\nAnd which is worse, all you have done\nHath been but for a wayward son,\nSpiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,\nLoves for his own ends, not for you.\nBut make amends now. Get you gone,\nAnd at the pit of Acheron\nMeet me i' th' morning. Thither he\nWill come to know his destiny.\nYour vessels and your spells provide,\nYour charms and everything beside.\nI am for th' air. This night I'll spend\nUnto a dismal and a fatal end.\nGreat business must be wrought ere noon.\nUpon the corner of the moon\nThere hangs a vap'rous drop profound.\nI'll catch it ere it come to ground,\nAnd that, distilled by magic sleights,\nShall raise such artificial sprites\nAs by the strength of their illusion\nShall draw him on to his confusion.\nHe shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear\nHis hopes 'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.\nAnd you all know, security\nIs mortals' chiefest enemy.\n[Music and a song.]\nHark! I am called. My little spirit, see,\nSits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.\t[Hecate exits.]\n[Sing within \"Come away, come away,\" etc.]\n\nFIRST WITCH\nCome, let's make haste. She'll soon be back again.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 6\n=======\n[Enter Lennox and another Lord.]\n\n\nLENNOX\nMy former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\nWhich can interpret farther. Only I say\nThings have been strangely borne. The gracious\nDuncan\nWas pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.\nAnd the right valiant Banquo walked too late,\nWhom you may say, if 't please you, Fleance killed,\nFor Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.\nWho cannot want the thought how monstrous\nIt was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\nTo kill their gracious father? Damned fact,\nHow it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight\nIn pious rage the two delinquents tear\nThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\nWas not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely, too,\nFor 'twould have angered any heart alive\nTo hear the men deny 't. So that I say\nHe has borne all things well. And I do think\nThat had he Duncan's sons under his key\n(As, an 't please heaven, he shall not) they should\nfind\nWhat 'twere to kill a father. So should Fleance.\nBut peace. For from broad words, and 'cause he\nfailed\nHis presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear\nMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\nWhere he bestows himself?\n\nLORD  The son of Duncan\n(From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth)\nLives in the English court and is received\nOf the most pious Edward with such grace\nThat the malevolence of fortune nothing\nTakes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\nIs gone to pray the holy king upon his aid\nTo wake Northumberland and warlike Siward\nThat, by the help of these (with Him above\nTo ratify the work), we may again\nGive to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,\nFree from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\nDo faithful homage, and receive free honors,\nAll which we pine for now. And this report\nHath so exasperate the King that he\nPrepares for some attempt of war.\n\nLENNOX  Sent he to Macduff?\n\nLORD\nHe did, and with an absolute \"Sir, not I,\"\nThe cloudy messenger turns me his back\nAnd hums, as who should say \"You'll rue the time\nThat clogs me with this answer.\"\n\nLENNOX  And that well might\nAdvise him to a caution t' hold what distance\nHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angel\nFly to the court of England and unfold\nHis message ere he come, that a swift blessing\nMay soon return to this our suffering country\nUnder a hand accursed.\n\nLORD  I'll send my prayers with him.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 4\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Thunder.

Thou shalt not live,\nThat I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,\nAnd sleep in spite of thunder.\n\n[Thunder. Third Apparition, a Child Crowned, with a tree\nin his hand.]\n\nWhat is this\nThat rises like the issue of a king\nAnd wears upon his baby brow the round\nAnd top of sovereignty?\n\nALL  Listen but speak not to 't.\n\nTHIRD APPARITION\nBe lion-mettled, proud, and take no care\nWho chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.\nMacbeth shall never vanquished be until\nGreat Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill\nShall come against him.\t[He descends.]\n\nMACBETH  That will never be.\nWho can impress the forest, bid the tree\nUnfix his earthbound root? Sweet bodements, good!\nRebellious dead, rise never till the Wood\nOf Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth\nShall live the lease of nature, pay his breath\nTo time and mortal custom.

Start, eyes!\nWhat, will the line stretch out to th' crack of doom?\nAnother yet? A seventh? I'll see no more.\nAnd yet the eighth appears who bears a glass\nWhich shows me many more, and some I see\nThat twofold balls and treble scepters carry.\nHorrible sight! Now I see 'tis true,\nFor the blood-boltered Banquo smiles upon me\nAnd points at them for his.\n[The Apparitions disappear.]\nWhat, is this so?\n\nFIRST WITCH\nAy, sir, all this is so. But why\nStands Macbeth thus amazedly?\nCome, sisters, cheer we up his sprites\nAnd show the best of our delights.\nI'll charm the air to give a sound\nWhile you perform your antic round,\nThat this great king may kindly say\nOur duties did his welcome pay.\n[Music.

He loves us not;\nHe wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,\nThe most diminutive of birds, will fight,\nHer young ones in her nest, against the owl.\nAll is the fear, and nothing is the love,\nAs little is the wisdom, where the flight\nSo runs against all reason.\n\nROSS  My dearest coz,\nI pray you school yourself. But for your husband,\nHe is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows\nThe fits o' th' season. I dare not speak much\nfurther;\nBut cruel are the times when we are traitors\nAnd do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor\nFrom what we fear, yet know not what we fear,\nBut float upon a wild and violent sea\nEach way and move--I take my leave of you.\nShall not be long but I'll be here again.\nThings at the worst will cease or else climb upward\nTo what they were before.--My pretty cousin,\nBlessing upon you.\n\nLADY MACDUFF\nFathered he is, and yet he's fatherless.\n\nROSS\nI am so much a fool, should I stay longer\nIt would be my disgrace and your discomfort.\nI take my leave at once.\t[Ross exits.]\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Sirrah, your father's dead.\nAnd what will you do now? How will you live?\n\nSON\nAs birds do, mother.\n\nLADY MACDUFF  What, with worms and flies?\n\nSON\nWith what I get, I mean; and so do they.\n\nLADY MACDUFF\nPoor bird, thou 'dst never fear the net nor lime,\nThe pitfall nor the gin.\n\nSON\nWhy should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set\nfor.\nMy father is not dead, for all your saying.\n\nLADY MACDUFF\nYes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?\n\nSON  Nay, how will you do for a husband?\n\nLADY MACDUFF\nWhy, I can buy me twenty at any market.\n\nSON  Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Thou speak'st with all thy wit,\nAnd yet, i' faith, with wit enough for thee.\n\nSON  Was my father a traitor, mother?\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Ay, that he was.\n\nSON  What is a traitor?\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Why, one that swears and lies.\n\nSON  And be all traitors that do so?\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Every one that does so is a traitor\nand must be hanged.\n\nSON  And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Every one.\n\nSON  Who must hang them?\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Why, the honest men.\n\nSON  Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there\nare liars and swearers enough to beat the honest\nmen and hang up them.\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Now God help thee, poor monkey! But\nhow wilt thou do for a father?\n\nSON  If he were dead, you'd weep for him. If you would\nnot, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a\nnew father.\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!\n\n[Enter a Messenger.]\n\n\nMESSENGER\nBless you, fair dame.

Heaven preserve\nyou!\nI dare abide no longer.\t[Messenger exits.]\n\nLADY MACDUFF  Whither should I fly?\nI have done no harm. But I remember now\nI am in this earthly world, where to do harm\nIs often laudable, to do good sometime\nAccounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,\nDo I put up that womanly defense\nTo say I have done no harm?\n\n[Enter Murderers.]\n\nWhat are these faces?\n\nMURDERER  Where is your husband?\n\nLADY MACDUFF\nI hope in no place so unsanctified\nWhere such as thou mayst find him.\n\nMURDERER  He's a traitor.\n\nSON\nThou liest, thou shag-eared villain!\n\nMURDERER  What, you egg?\n[Stabbing him.] Young fry of treachery!\n\nSON  He has killed\nme, mother.\nRun away, I pray you.\n[Lady Macduff exits, crying \"Murder!\" followed by the\nMurderers bearing the Son's body.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Malcolm and Macduff.]\n\n\nMALCOLM\nLet us seek out some desolate shade and there\nWeep our sad bosoms empty.\n\nMACDUFF  Let us rather\nHold fast the mortal sword and, like good men,\nBestride our downfall'n birthdom. Each new morn\nNew widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows\nStrike heaven on the face, that it resounds\nAs if it felt with Scotland, and yelled out\nLike syllable of dolor.\n\nMALCOLM  What I believe, I'll wail;\nWhat know, believe; and what I can redress,\nAs I shall find the time to friend, I will.\nWhat you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.\nThis tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\nWas once thought honest. You have loved him well.\nHe hath not touched you yet. I am young, but\nsomething\nYou may deserve of him through me, and wisdom\nTo offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb\nT' appease an angry god.\n\nMACDUFF\nI am not treacherous.\n\nMALCOLM  But Macbeth is.\nA good and virtuous nature may recoil\nIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave your\npardon.\nThat which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\nAngels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\nThough all things foul would wear the brows of\ngrace,\nYet grace must still look so.\n\nMACDUFF  I have lost my hopes.\n\nMALCOLM\nPerchance even there where I did find my doubts.\nWhy in that rawness left you wife and child,\nThose precious motives, those strong knots of love,\nWithout leave-taking? I pray you,\nLet not my jealousies be your dishonors,\nBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\nWhatever I shall think.\n\nMACDUFF  Bleed, bleed, poor country!\nGreat tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,\nFor goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy\nwrongs;\nThe title is affeered.--Fare thee well, lord.\nI would not be the villain that thou think'st\nFor the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,\nAnd the rich East to boot.\n\nMALCOLM  Be not offended.\nI speak not as in absolute fear of you.\nI think our country sinks beneath the yoke.\nIt weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\nIs added to her wounds. I think withal\nThere would be hands uplifted in my right;\nAnd here from gracious England have I offer\nOf goodly thousands. But, for all this,\nWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant's head\nOr wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\nShall have more vices than it had before,\nMore suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,\nBy him that shall succeed.\n\nMACDUFF  What should he be?\n\nMALCOLM\nIt is myself I mean, in whom I know\nAll the particulars of vice so grafted\nThat, when they shall be opened, black Macbeth\nWill seem as pure as snow, and the poor state\nEsteem him as a lamb, being compared\nWith my confineless harms.\n\nMACDUFF  Not in the legions\nOf horrid hell can come a devil more damned\nIn evils to top Macbeth.\n\nMALCOLM  I grant him bloody,\nLuxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\nSudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\nThat has a name. But there's no bottom, none,\nIn my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,\nYour matrons, and your maids could not fill up\nThe cistern of my lust, and my desire\nAll continent impediments would o'erbear\nThat did oppose my will. Better Macbeth\nThan such an one to reign.\n\nMACDUFF  Boundless intemperance\nIn nature is a tyranny. It hath been\nTh' untimely emptying of the happy throne\nAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yet\nTo take upon you what is yours. You may\nConvey your pleasures in a spacious plenty\nAnd yet seem cold--the time you may so hoodwink.\nWe have willing dames enough. There cannot be\nThat vulture in you to devour so many\nAs will to greatness dedicate themselves,\nFinding it so inclined.\n\nMALCOLM  With this there grows\nIn my most ill-composed affection such\nA stanchless avarice that, were I king,\nI should cut off the nobles for their lands,\nDesire his jewels, and this other's house;\nAnd my more-having would be as a sauce\nTo make me hunger more, that I should forge\nQuarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\nDestroying them for wealth.\n\nMACDUFF  This avarice\nSticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root\nThan summer-seeming lust, and it hath been\nThe sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear.\nScotland hath foisons to fill up your will\nOf your mere own. All these are portable,\nWith other graces weighed.\n\nMALCOLM\nBut I have none. The king-becoming graces,\nAs justice, verity, temp'rance, stableness,\nBounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\nDevotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\nI have no relish of them but abound\nIn the division of each several crime,\nActing it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\nPour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\nUproar the universal peace, confound\nAll unity on earth.\n\nMACDUFF  O Scotland, Scotland!\n\nMALCOLM\nIf such a one be fit to govern, speak.\nI am as I have spoken.\n\nMACDUFF  Fit to govern?\nNo, not to live.--O nation miserable,\nWith an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptered,\nWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\nSince that the truest issue of thy throne\nBy his own interdiction stands accursed\nAnd does blaspheme his breed?--Thy royal father\nWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,\nOft'ner upon her knees than on her feet,\nDied every day she lived. Fare thee well.\nThese evils thou repeat'st upon thyself\nHath banished me from Scotland.--O my breast,\nThy hope ends here!\n\nMALCOLM  Macduff, this noble passion,\nChild of integrity, hath from my soul\nWiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts\nTo thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth\nBy many of these trains hath sought to win me\nInto his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\nFrom overcredulous haste. But God above\nDeal between thee and me, for even now\nI put myself to thy direction and\nUnspeak mine own detraction, here abjure\nThe taints and blames I laid upon myself\nFor strangers to my nature. I am yet\nUnknown to woman, never was forsworn,\nScarcely have coveted what was mine own,\nAt no time broke my faith, would not betray\nThe devil to his fellow, and delight\nNo less in truth than life. My first false speaking\nWas this upon myself. What I am truly\nIs thine and my poor country's to command--\nWhither indeed, before thy here-approach,\nOld Siward with ten thousand warlike men,\nAlready at a point, was setting forth.\nNow we'll together, and the chance of goodness\nBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?\n\nMACDUFF\nSuch welcome and unwelcome things at once\n'Tis hard to reconcile.\n\n[Enter a Doctor.]\n\n\nMALCOLM  Well, more anon.--\nComes the King forth, I pray you?\n\nDOCTOR\nAy, sir. There are a crew of wretched souls\nThat stay his cure. Their malady convinces\nThe great assay of art, but at his touch\n(Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand)\nThey presently amend.\n\nMALCOLM  I thank you, doctor.\n[Doctor exits.]\n\nMACDUFF\nWhat's the disease he means?\n\nMALCOLM  'Tis called the evil:\nA most miraculous work in this good king,\nWhich often since my here-remain in England\nI have seen him do. How he solicits heaven\nHimself best knows, but strangely visited people\nAll swoll'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\nThe mere despair of surgery, he cures,\nHanging a golden stamp about their necks,\nPut on with holy prayers; and, 'tis spoken,\nTo the succeeding royalty he leaves\nThe healing benediction. With this strange virtue,\nHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,\nAnd sundry blessings hang about his throne\nThat speak him full of grace.\n\n[Enter Ross.]\n\n\nMACDUFF  See who comes here.\n\nMALCOLM\nMy countryman, but yet I know him not.\n\nMACDUFF\nMy ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.\n\nMALCOLM\nI know him now.--Good God betimes remove\nThe means that makes us strangers!\n\nROSS  Sir, amen.\n\nMACDUFF\nStands Scotland where it did?\n\nROSS  Alas, poor country,\nAlmost afraid to know itself. It cannot\nBe called our mother, but our grave, where nothing\nBut who knows nothing is once seen to smile;\nWhere sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the air\nAre made, not marked; where violent sorrow seems\nA modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell\nIs there scarce asked for who, and good men's lives\nExpire before the flowers in their caps,\nDying or ere they sicken.\n\nMACDUFF\nO relation too nice and yet too true!\n\nMALCOLM  What's the newest grief?\n\nROSS\nThat of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker.\nEach minute teems a new one.\n\nMACDUFF  How does my wife?\n\nROSS  Why, well.\n\nMACDUFF  And all my children?\n\nROSS  Well too.\n\nMACDUFF\nThe tyrant has not battered at their peace?\n\nROSS\nNo, they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.\n\nMACDUFF\nBe not a niggard of your speech. How goes 't?\n\nROSS\nWhen I came hither to transport the tidings\nWhich I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor\nOf many worthy fellows that were out;\nWhich was to my belief witnessed the rather\nFor that I saw the tyrant's power afoot.\nNow is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland\nWould create soldiers, make our women fight\nTo doff their dire distresses.\n\nMALCOLM  Be 't their comfort\nWe are coming thither. Gracious England hath\nLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\nAn older and a better soldier none\nThat Christendom gives out.\n\nROSS  Would I could answer\nThis comfort with the like. But I have words\nThat would be howled out in the desert air,\nWhere hearing should not latch them.\n\nMACDUFF  What concern\nthey--\nThe general cause, or is it a fee-grief\nDue to some single breast?\n\nROSS  No mind that's honest\nBut in it shares some woe, though the main part\nPertains to you alone.\n\nMACDUFF  If it be mine,\nKeep it not from me. Quickly let me have it.\n\nROSS\nLet not your ears despise my tongue forever,\nWhich shall possess them with the heaviest sound\nThat ever yet they heard.\n\nMACDUFF  Hum! I guess at it.\n\nROSS\nYour castle is surprised, your wife and babes\nSavagely slaughtered. To relate the manner\nWere on the quarry of these murdered deer\nTo add the death of you.\n\nMALCOLM  Merciful heaven!--\nWhat, man, ne'er pull your hat upon your brows.\nGive sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\nWhispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break.\n\nMACDUFF  My children too?\n\nROSS\nWife, children, servants, all that could be found.\n\nMACDUFF\nAnd I must be from thence? My wife killed too?\n\nROSS  I have said.\n\nMALCOLM  Be comforted.\nLet's make us med'cines of our great revenge\nTo cure this deadly grief.\n\nMACDUFF\nHe has no children. All my pretty ones?\nDid you say \"all\"? O hell-kite! All?\nWhat, all my pretty chickens and their dam\nAt one fell swoop?\n\nMALCOLM  Dispute it like a man.\n\nMACDUFF  I shall do so,\nBut I must also feel it as a man.\nI cannot but remember such things were\nThat were most precious to me. Did heaven look on\nAnd would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\nThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\nNot for their own demerits, but for mine,\nFell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now.\n\nMALCOLM\nBe this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\nConvert to anger. Blunt not the heart; enrage it.\n\nMACDUFF\nO, I could play the woman with mine eyes\nAnd braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,\nCut short all intermission! Front to front\nBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.\nWithin my sword's length set him. If he 'scape,\nHeaven forgive him too.\n\nMALCOLM  This tune goes manly.\nCome, go we to the King. Our power is ready;\nOur lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\nIs ripe for shaking, and the powers above\nPut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you\nmay.\nThe night is long that never finds the day.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 5\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.]\n\n\nDOCTOR  I have two nights watched with you but can\nperceive no truth in your report. When was it she\nlast walked?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  Since his Majesty went into the field, I\nhave seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown\nupon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper,\nfold it, write upon 't, read it, afterwards seal it, and\nagain return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast\nsleep.\n\nDOCTOR  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at\nonce the benefit of sleep and do the effects of\nwatching. In this slumb'ry agitation, besides her\nwalking and other actual performances, what at any\ntime have you heard her say?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  That, sir, which I will not report after\nher.\n\nDOCTOR  You may to me, and 'tis most meet you\nshould.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  Neither to you nor anyone, having no\nwitness to confirm my speech.\n\n[Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.]\n\nLo you, here she comes. This is her very guise and,\nupon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.\n\nDOCTOR  How came she by that light?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  Why, it stood by her. She has light by\nher continually. 'Tis her command.\n\nDOCTOR  You see her eyes are open.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  Ay, but their sense are shut.\n\nDOCTOR  What is it she does now? Look how she rubs\nher hands.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  It is an accustomed action with her to\nseem thus washing her hands. I have known her\ncontinue in this a quarter of an hour.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Yet here's a spot.\n\nDOCTOR  Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes\nfrom her, to satisfy my remembrance the more\nstrongly.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Out, damned spot, out, I say! One. Two.\nWhy then, 'tis time to do 't. Hell is murky. Fie, my\nlord, fie, a soldier and afeard? What need we fear\nwho knows it, when none can call our power to\naccount? Yet who would have thought the old man\nto have had so much blood in him?\n\nDOCTOR  Do you mark that?\n\nLADY MACBETH  The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is\nshe now? What, will these hands ne'er be clean? No\nmore o' that, my lord, no more o' that. You mar all\nwith this starting.\n\nDOCTOR  Go to, go to. You have known what you should\nnot.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  She has spoke what she should not,\nI am sure of that. Heaven knows what she has\nknown.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Here's the smell of the blood still. All\nthe perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little\nhand. O, O, O!\n\nDOCTOR  What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely\ncharged.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  I would not have such a heart in my\nbosom for the dignity of the whole body.\n\nDOCTOR  Well, well, well.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  Pray God it be, sir.\n\nDOCTOR  This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have\nknown those which have walked in their sleep,\nwho have died holily in their beds.\n\nLADY MACBETH  Wash your hands. Put on your nightgown.\nLook not so pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo's\nburied; he cannot come out on 's grave.\n\nDOCTOR  Even so?\n\nLADY MACBETH  To bed, to bed. There's knocking at the\ngate. Come, come, come, come. Give me your\nhand. What's done cannot be undone. To bed, to\nbed, to bed.\t[Lady Macbeth exits.]\n\nDOCTOR  Will she go now to bed?\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  Directly.\n\nDOCTOR\nFoul whisp'rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds\nDo breed unnatural troubles. Infected minds\nTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.\nMore needs she the divine than the physician.\nGod, God forgive us all. Look after her.\nRemove from her the means of all annoyance\nAnd still keep eyes upon her. So, good night.\nMy mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.\nI think but dare not speak.\n\nGENTLEWOMAN  Good night, good doctor.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Drum and Colors.

That way are they coming.\n\nCAITHNESS\nWho knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\n\nLENNOX\nFor certain, sir, he is not. I have a file\nOf all the gentry.

But for certain\nHe cannot buckle his distempered cause\nWithin the belt of rule.\n\nANGUS  Now does he feel\nHis secret murders sticking on his hands.\nNow minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach.\nThose he commands move only in command,\nNothing in love. Now does he feel his title\nHang loose about him, like a giant's robe\nUpon a dwarfish thief.\n\nMENTEITH  Who, then, shall blame\nHis pestered senses to recoil and start\nWhen all that is within him does condemn\nItself for being there?\n\nCAITHNESS  Well, march we on\nTo give obedience where 'tis truly owed.\nMeet we the med'cine of the sickly weal,\nAnd with him pour we in our country's purge\nEach drop of us.\n\nLENNOX  Or so much as it needs\nTo dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.\nMake we our march towards Birnam.\n[They exit marching.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Macbeth, the Doctor, and Attendants.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nBring me no more reports.

If thy speech be sooth,\nI care not if thou dost for me as much.--\nI pull in resolution and begin\nTo doubt th' equivocation of the fiend,\nThat lies like truth. \"Fear not till Birnam Wood\nDo come to Dunsinane,\" and now a wood\nComes toward Dunsinane.--Arm, arm, and out!--\nIf this which he avouches does appear,\nThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\nI 'gin to be aweary of the sun\nAnd wish th' estate o' th' world were now\nundone.--\nRing the alarum bell!--Blow wind, come wrack,\nAt least we'll die with harness on our back.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 6\n=======\n[Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, and\ntheir army, with boughs.]\n\n\nMALCOLM\nNow near enough. Your leafy screens throw down\nAnd show like those you are.--You, worthy uncle,\nShall with my cousin, your right noble son,\nLead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we\nShall take upon 's what else remains to do,\nAccording to our order.\n\nSIWARD  Fare you well.\nDo we but find the tyrant's power tonight,\nLet us be beaten if we cannot fight.\n\nMACDUFF\nMake all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,\nThose clamorous harbingers of blood and death.\n[They exit.]\n[Alarums continued.]\n\nScene 7\n=======\n[Enter Macbeth.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nThey have tied me to a stake. I cannot fly,\nBut, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he\nThat was not born of woman? Such a one\nAm I to fear, or none.\n\n[Enter young Siward.]\n\n\nYOUNG SIWARD  What is thy name?\n\nMACBETH  Thou 'lt be afraid to hear it.\n\nYOUNG SIWARD\nNo, though thou call'st thyself a hotter name\nThan any is in hell.\n\nMACBETH  My name's Macbeth.\n\nYOUNG SIWARD\nThe devil himself could not pronounce a title\nMore hateful to mine ear.\n\nMACBETH  No, nor more fearful.\n\nYOUNG SIWARD\nThou liest, abhorred tyrant. With my sword\nI'll prove the lie thou speak'st.\n[They fight, and young Siward is slain.]\n\nMACBETH  Thou wast born of\nwoman.\nBut swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,\nBrandished by man that's of a woman born.\n[He exits.]\n\n[Alarums. Enter Macduff.]\n\n\nMACDUFF\nThat way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!\nIf thou beest slain, and with no stroke of mine,\nMy wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.\nI cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms\nAre hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,\nOr else my sword with an unbattered edge\nI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\nBy this great clatter, one of greatest note\nSeems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune,\nAnd more I beg not.\t[He exits. Alarums.]\n\n[Enter Malcolm and Siward.]\n\n\nSIWARD\nThis way, my lord. The castle's gently rendered.\nThe tyrant's people on both sides do fight,\nThe noble thanes do bravely in the war,\nThe day almost itself professes yours,\nAnd little is to do.\n\nMALCOLM  We have met with foes\nThat strike beside us.\n\nSIWARD  Enter, sir, the castle.\n[They exit. Alarum.]\n\nScene 8\n=======\n[Enter Macbeth.]\n\n\nMACBETH\nWhy should I play the Roman fool and die\nOn mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes\nDo better upon them.\n\n[Enter Macduff.]\n\n\nMACDUFF  Turn, hellhound, turn!\n\nMACBETH\nOf all men else I have avoided thee.\nBut get thee back. My soul is too much charged\nWith blood of thine already.\n\nMACDUFF  I have no words;\nMy voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain\nThan terms can give thee out.\t[Fight. Alarum.]\n\nMACBETH  Thou losest labor.\nAs easy mayst thou the intrenchant air\nWith thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.\nLet fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;\nI bear a charmed life, which must not yield\nTo one of woman born.\n\nMACDUFF  Despair thy charm,\nAnd let the angel whom thou still hast served\nTell thee Macduff was from his mother's womb\nUntimely ripped.\n\nMACBETH\nAccursed be that tongue that tells me so,\nFor it hath cowed my better part of man!\nAnd be these juggling fiends no more believed\nThat palter with us in a double sense,\nThat keep the word of promise to our ear\nAnd break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.\n\nMACDUFF  Then yield thee, coward,\nAnd live to be the show and gaze o' th' time.\nWe'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,\nPainted upon a pole, and underwrit\n\"Here may you see the tyrant.\"\n\nMACBETH  I will not yield\nTo kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet\nAnd to be baited with the rabble's curse.\nThough Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane\nAnd thou opposed, being of no woman born,\nYet I will try the last. Before my body\nI throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,\nAnd damned be him that first cries \"Hold! Enough!\"\n[They exit fighting. Alarums.]\n\n[They enter fighting, and Macbeth is slain. Macduff\nexits carrying off Macbeth's body. Retreat and flourish.\nEnter, with Drum and Colors, Malcolm, Siward, Ross,\nThanes, and Soldiers.]\n\n\nMALCOLM\nI would the friends we miss were safe arrived.\n\nSIWARD\nSome must go off; and yet by these I see\nSo great a day as this is cheaply bought.\n\nMALCOLM\nMacduff is missing, and your noble son.\n\nROSS\nYour son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt.\nHe only lived but till he was a man,\nThe which no sooner had his prowess confirmed\nIn the unshrinking station where he fought,\nBut like a man he died.\n\nSIWARD  Then he is dead?\n\nROSS\nAy, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow\nMust not be measured by his worth, for then\nIt hath no end.\n\nSIWARD  Had he his hurts before?\n\nROSS\nAy, on the front.\n\nSIWARD  Why then, God's soldier be he!\nHad I as many sons as I have hairs,\nI would not wish them to a fairer death;\nAnd so his knell is knolled.\n\nMALCOLM\nHe's worth more sorrow, and that I'll spend for\nhim.\n\nSIWARD  He's worth no more.\nThey say he parted well and paid his score,\nAnd so, God be with him. Here comes newer\ncomfort.\n\n[Enter Macduff with Macbeth's head.]\n\n\nMACDUFF\nHail, King! for so thou art. Behold where stands\nTh' usurper's cursed head. The time is free.\nI see thee compassed with thy kingdom's pearl,\nThat speak my salutation in their minds,\nWhose voices I desire aloud with mine.\nHail, King of Scotland!\n\nALL  Hail, King of Scotland!\t[Flourish.]\n\nMALCOLM\nWe shall not spend a large expense of time\nBefore we reckon with your several loves\nAnd make us even with you. My thanes and\nkinsmen,\nHenceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland\nIn such an honor named. What's more to do,\nWhich would be planted newly with the time,\nAs calling home our exiled friends abroad\nThat fled the snares of watchful tyranny,\nProducing forth the cruel ministers\nOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen\n(Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands,\nTook off her life)--this, and what needful else\nThat calls upon us, by the grace of grace,\nWe will perform in measure, time, and place.\nSo thanks to all at once and to each one,\nWhom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.\n[Flourish.

Mowat and Paul Werstine\n  with Michael Poston and Rebecca Niles\nFolger Shakespeare Library\nhttps://shakespeare.folger.edu/shakespeares-works/othello/\nCreated on May 11, 2016, from FDT version 0.9.2.1\n\nCharacters in the Play\n======================\nOTHELLO, a Moorish general in the Venetian army\nDESDEMONA, a Venetian lady\nBRABANTIO, a Venetian senator, father to Desdemona\nIAGO, Othello's standard-bearer, or \"ancient\"\nEMILIA, Iago's wife and Desdemona's attendant\nCASSIO, Othello's second-in-command, or lieutenant\nRODERIGO, a Venetian gentleman\nDuke of Venice\nVenetian gentlemen, kinsmen to Brabantio:\n  LODOVICO\n  GRATIANO\nVenetian senators\nMONTANO, an official in Cyprus\nBIANCA, a woman in Cyprus in love with Cassio\nClown, a comic servant to Othello and Desdemona\nGentlemen of Cyprus\nSailors\nServants, Attendants, Officers, Messengers, Herald, Musicians, Torchbearers.\n\n\nACT 1\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Roderigo and Iago.]\n\n\nRODERIGO\nTush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly\nThat thou, Iago, who hast had my purse\nAs if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.\n\nIAGO  'Sblood, but you'll not hear me!\nIf ever I did dream of such a matter,\nAbhor me.\n\nRODERIGO\nThou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.\n\nIAGO  Despise me\nIf I do not. Three great ones of the city,\nIn personal suit to make me his lieutenant,\nOff-capped to him; and, by the faith of man,\nI know my price, I am worth no worse a place.\nBut he, as loving his own pride and purposes,\nEvades them with a bombast circumstance,\nHorribly stuffed with epithets of war,\nAnd in conclusion,\nNonsuits my mediators. For \"Certes,\" says he,\n\"I have already chose my officer.\"\nAnd what was he?\nForsooth, a great arithmetician,\nOne Michael Cassio, a Florentine,\nA fellow almost damned in a fair wife,\nThat never set a squadron in the field,\nNor the division of a battle knows\nMore than a spinster--unless the bookish theoric,\nWherein the toged consuls can propose\nAs masterly as he. Mere prattle without practice\nIs all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th' election;\nAnd I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof\nAt Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds\nChristened and heathen, must be beleed and\ncalmed\nBy debitor and creditor. This countercaster,\nHe, in good time, must his lieutenant be,\nAnd I, God bless the mark, his Moorship's ancient.\n\nRODERIGO\nBy heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.\n\nIAGO\nWhy, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service.\nPreferment goes by letter and affection,\nAnd not by old gradation, where each second\nStood heir to th' first. Now, sir, be judge yourself\nWhether I in any just term am affined\nTo love the Moor.\n\nRODERIGO\nI would not follow him, then.\n\nIAGO  O, sir, content you.\nI follow him to serve my turn upon him.\nWe cannot all be masters, nor all masters\nCannot be truly followed. You shall mark\nMany a duteous and knee-crooking knave\nThat, doting on his own obsequious bondage,\nWears out his time, much like his master's ass,\nFor naught but provender, and when he's old,\ncashiered.\nWhip me such honest knaves! Others there are\nWho, trimmed in forms and visages of duty,\nKeep yet their hearts attending on themselves,\nAnd, throwing but shows of service on their lords,\nDo well thrive by them; and when they have lined\ntheir coats,\nDo themselves homage. These fellows have some\nsoul,\nAnd such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,\nIt is as sure as you are Roderigo,\nWere I the Moor I would not be Iago.\nIn following him, I follow but myself.\nHeaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,\nBut seeming so for my peculiar end.\nFor when my outward action doth demonstrate\nThe native act and figure of my heart\nIn complement extern, 'tis not long after\nBut I will wear my heart upon my sleeve\nFor daws to peck at. I am not what I am.\n\nRODERIGO\nWhat a full fortune does the thick-lips owe\nIf he can carry 't thus!\n\nIAGO  Call up her father.\nRouse him. Make after him, poison his delight,\nProclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,\nAnd, though he in a fertile climate dwell,\nPlague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,\nYet throw such chances of vexation on 't\nAs it may lose some color.\n\nRODERIGO\nHere is her father's house. I'll call aloud.\n\nIAGO\nDo, with like timorous accent and dire yell\nAs when, by night and negligence, the fire\nIs spied in populous cities.\n\nRODERIGO\nWhat ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!\n\nIAGO\nAwake! What ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!\nLook to your house, your daughter, and your bags!\nThieves, thieves!\n\n[Enter Brabantio, above.]\n\n\nBRABANTIO\nWhat is the reason of this terrible summons?\nWhat is the matter there?\n\nRODERIGO\nSignior, is all your family within?\n\nIAGO\nAre your doors locked?\n\nBRABANTIO  Why, wherefore ask you this?\n\nIAGO\nZounds, sir, you're robbed. For shame, put on your\ngown!\nYour heart is burst. You have lost half your soul.\nEven now, now, very now, an old black ram\nIs tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise!\nAwake the snorting citizens with the bell,\nOr else the devil will make a grandsire of you.\nArise, I say!\n\nBRABANTIO  What, have you lost your wits?\n\nRODERIGO\nMost reverend signior, do you know my voice?\n\nBRABANTIO  Not I. What are you?\n\nRODERIGO\nMy name is Roderigo.\n\nBRABANTIO  The worser welcome.\nI have charged thee not to haunt about my doors.\nIn honest plainness thou hast heard me say\nMy daughter is not for thee. And now in madness,\nBeing full of supper and distemp'ring draughts,\nUpon malicious bravery dost thou come\nTo start my quiet.\n\nRODERIGO  Sir, sir, sir--\n\nBRABANTIO  But thou must needs be sure\nMy spirit and my place have in them power\nTo make this bitter to thee.\n\nRODERIGO\nPatience, good sir.\n\nBRABANTIO  What tell'st thou me of robbing?\nThis is Venice. My house is not a grange.\n\nRODERIGO  Most grave Brabantio,\nIn simple and pure soul I come to you--\n\nIAGO  Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not\nserve God if the devil bid you. Because we come to\ndo you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll\nhave your daughter covered with a Barbary horse,\nyou'll have your nephews neigh to you, you'll have\ncoursers for cousins and jennets for germans.\n\nBRABANTIO  What profane wretch art thou?\n\nIAGO  I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter\nand the Moor are now making the beast with\ntwo backs.\n\nBRABANTIO  Thou art a villain.\n\nIAGO  You are a senator.\n\nBRABANTIO\nThis thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.\n\nRODERIGO\nSir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,\nIf 't be your pleasure and most wise consent--\nAs partly I find it is--that your fair daughter,\nAt this odd-even and dull watch o' th' night,\nTransported with no worse nor better guard\nBut with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,\nTo the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:\nIf this be known to you, and your allowance,\nWe then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.\nBut if you know not this, my manners tell me\nWe have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe\nThat from the sense of all civility\nI thus would play and trifle with your Reverence.\nYour daughter, if you have not given her leave,\nI say again, hath made a gross revolt,\nTying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes\nIn an extravagant and wheeling stranger\nOf here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself.\nIf she be in her chamber or your house,\nLet loose on me the justice of the state\nFor thus deluding you.\n\nBRABANTIO  Strike on the tinder, ho!\nGive me a taper. Call up all my people.\nThis accident is not unlike my dream.\nBelief of it oppresses me already.\nLight, I say, light!\t[He exits.]\n\nIAGO, [to Roderigo]  Farewell, for I must leave you.\nIt seems not meet nor wholesome to my place\nTo be producted, as if I stay I shall,\nAgainst the Moor. For I do know the state,\nHowever this may gall him with some check,\nCannot with safety cast him, for he's embarked\nWith such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,\nWhich even now stands in act, that, for their souls,\nAnother of his fathom they have none\nTo lead their business. In which regard,\nThough I do hate him as I do hell pains,\nYet, for necessity of present life,\nI must show out a flag and sign of love--\nWhich is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find\nhim,\nLead to the Sagittary the raised search,\nAnd there will I be with him. So, farewell.\t[He exits.]\n\n[Enter Brabantio in his nightgown, with Servants and\nTorches.]\n\n\nBRABANTIO\nIt is too true an evil. Gone she is,\nAnd what's to come of my despised time\nIs naught but bitterness.--Now, Roderigo,\nWhere didst thou see her?--O, unhappy girl!--\nWith the Moor, sayst thou?--Who would be a\nfather?--\nHow didst thou know 'twas she?--O, she deceives\nme\nPast thought!--What said she to you?--Get more\ntapers.\nRaise all my kindred.--Are they married, think\nyou?\n\nRODERIGO  Truly, I think they are.\n\nBRABANTIO\nO heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!\nFathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds\nBy what you see them act.--Is there not charms\nBy which the property of youth and maidhood\nMay be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,\nOf some such thing?\n\nRODERIGO  Yes, sir, I have indeed.\n\nBRABANTIO\nCall up my brother.--O, would you had had her!--\nSome one way, some another.--Do you know\nWhere we may apprehend her and the Moor?\n\nRODERIGO\nI think I can discover him, if you please\nTo get good guard and go along with me.\n\nBRABANTIO\nPray you lead on. At every house I'll call.\nI may command at most.--Get weapons, ho!\nAnd raise some special officers of night.--\nOn, good Roderigo. I will deserve your pains.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants, with Torches.]\n\n\nIAGO\nThough in the trade of war I have slain men,\nYet do I hold it very stuff o' th' conscience\nTo do no contrived murder. I lack iniquity\nSometimes to do me service. Nine or ten times\nI had thought t' have yerked him here under the\nribs.\n\nOTHELLO\n'Tis better as it is.\n\nIAGO  Nay, but he prated\nAnd spoke such scurvy and provoking terms\nAgainst your Honor,\nThat with the little godliness I have\nI did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,\nAre you fast married? Be assured of this,\nThat the magnifico is much beloved,\nAnd hath in his effect a voice potential\nAs double as the Duke's. He will divorce you\nOr put upon you what restraint or grievance\nThe law (with all his might to enforce it on)\nWill give him cable.\n\nOTHELLO  Let him do his spite.\nMy services which I have done the signiory\nShall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know\n(Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,\nI shall promulgate) I fetch my life and being\nFrom men of royal siege, and my demerits\nMay speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune\nAs this that I have reached. For know, Iago,\nBut that I love the gentle Desdemona,\nI would not my unhoused free condition\nPut into circumscription and confine\nFor the sea's worth. But look, what lights come\nyond?\n\nIAGO\nThose are the raised father and his friends.\nYou were best go in.\n\nOTHELLO  Not I. I must be found.\nMy parts, my title, and my perfect soul\nShall manifest me rightly. Is it they?\n\nIAGO  By Janus, I think no.\n\n[Enter Cassio, with Officers, and Torches.]\n\n\nOTHELLO\nThe servants of the Duke and my lieutenant!\nThe goodness of the night upon you, friends.\nWhat is the news?\n\nCASSIO  The Duke does greet you, general,\nAnd he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,\nEven on the instant.\n\nOTHELLO  What is the matter, think you?\n\nCASSIO\nSomething from Cyprus, as I may divine.\nIt is a business of some heat. The galleys\nHave sent a dozen sequent messengers\nThis very night at one another's heels,\nAnd many of the Consuls, raised and met,\nAre at the Duke's already. You have been hotly\ncalled for.\nWhen, being not at your lodging to be found,\nThe Senate hath sent about three several quests\nTo search you out.\n\nOTHELLO  'Tis well I am found by you.\nI will but spend a word here in the house\nAnd go with you.\t[He exits.]\n\nCASSIO  Ancient, what makes he here?\n\nIAGO\nFaith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.\nIf it prove lawful prize, he's made forever.\n\nCASSIO\nI do not understand.\n\nIAGO  He's married.\n\nCASSIO  To who?\n\nIAGO\nMarry, to--\n\n[Reenter Othello.]\n\nCome, captain, will you go?\n\nOTHELLO  Have with you.\n\nCASSIO\nHere comes another troop to seek for you.\n\n[Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, with Officers, and Torches.]\n\n\nIAGO\nIt is Brabantio. General, be advised,\nHe comes to bad intent.\n\nOTHELLO  Holla, stand there!\n\nRODERIGO\nSignior, it is the Moor.\n\nBRABANTIO  Down with him,\nthief!\n[They draw their swords.]\n\nIAGO\nYou, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.\n\nOTHELLO\nKeep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust\nthem.\nGood signior, you shall more command with years\nThan with your weapons.\n\nBRABANTIO\nO, thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my\ndaughter?\nDamned as thou art, thou hast enchanted her!\nFor I'll refer me to all things of sense,\nIf she in chains of magic were not bound,\nWhether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,\nSo opposite to marriage that she shunned\nThe wealthy curled darlings of our nation,\nWould ever have, t' incur a general mock,\nRun from her guardage to the sooty bosom\nOf such a thing as thou--to fear, not to delight!\nJudge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense\nThat thou hast practiced on her with foul charms,\nAbused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals\nThat weakens motion. I'll have 't disputed on.\n'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.\nI therefore apprehend and do attach thee\nFor an abuser of the world, a practicer\nOf arts inhibited and out of warrant.--\nLay hold upon him. If he do resist,\nSubdue him at his peril.\n\nOTHELLO  Hold your hands,\nBoth you of my inclining and the rest.\nWere it my cue to fight, I should have known it\nWithout a prompter.--Whither will you that I go\nTo answer this your charge?\n\nBRABANTIO  To prison, till fit time\nOf law and course of direct session\nCall thee to answer.\n\nOTHELLO  What if I do obey?\nHow may the Duke be therewith satisfied,\nWhose messengers are here about my side,\nUpon some present business of the state,\nTo bring me to him?\n\nOFFICER  'Tis true, most worthy signior.\nThe Duke's in council, and your noble self\nI am sure is sent for.\n\nBRABANTIO  How? The Duke in council?\nIn this time of the night? Bring him away;\nMine's not an idle cause. The Duke himself,\nOr any of my brothers of the state,\nCannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own.\nFor if such actions may have passage free,\nBondslaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Duke, Senators, and Officers.]\n\n\nDUKE, [reading a paper]\nThere's no composition in these news\nThat gives them credit.\n\nFIRST SENATOR, [reading a paper]\nIndeed, they are disproportioned.\nMy letters say a hundred and seven galleys.\n\nDUKE\nAnd mine, a hundred forty.\n\nSECOND SENATOR, [reading a paper]\nAnd mine, two hundred.\nBut though they jump not on a just account\n(As in these cases, where the aim reports\n'Tis oft with difference), yet do they all confirm\nA Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.\n\nDUKE\nNay, it is possible enough to judgment.\nI do not so secure me in the error,\nBut the main article I do approve\nIn fearful sense.\n\nSAILOR, [within]  What ho, what ho, what ho!\n\n[Enter Sailor.]\n\n\nOFFICER  A messenger from the galleys.\n\nDUKE  Now, what's the business?\n\nSAILOR\nThe Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes.\nSo was I bid report here to the state\nBy Signior Angelo.\t[He exits.]\n\nDUKE\nHow say you by this change?\n\nFIRST SENATOR  This cannot be,\nBy no assay of reason. 'Tis a pageant\nTo keep us in false gaze. When we consider\nTh' importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,\nAnd let ourselves again but understand\nThat, as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,\nSo may he with more facile question bear it,\nFor that it stands not in such warlike brace,\nBut altogether lacks th' abilities\nThat Rhodes is dressed in--if we make thought of\nthis,\nWe must not think the Turk is so unskillful\nTo leave that latest which concerns him first,\nNeglecting an attempt of ease and gain\nTo wake and wage a danger profitless.\n\nDUKE\nNay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.\n\nOFFICER  Here is more news.\n\n[Enter a Messenger.]\n\n\nMESSENGER\nThe Ottomites, Reverend and Gracious,\nSteering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes,\nHave there injointed them with an after fleet.\n\nFIRST SENATOR\nAy, so I thought. How many, as you guess?\n\nMESSENGER\nOf thirty sail; and now they do restem\nTheir backward course, bearing with frank\nappearance\nTheir purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,\nYour trusty and most valiant servitor,\nWith his free duty recommends you thus,\nAnd prays you to believe him.\t[He exits.]\n\nDUKE  'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.\nMarcus Luccicos, is not he in town?\n\nFIRST SENATOR\nHe's now in Florence.\n\nDUKE  Write from us to him.\nPost-post-haste. Dispatch.\n\nFIRST SENATOR\nHere comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.\n\n[Enter Brabantio, Othello, Cassio, Iago, Roderigo, and\nOfficers.]\n\n\nDUKE\nValiant Othello, we must straight employ you\nAgainst the general enemy Ottoman.\n[To Brabantio.] I did not see you. Welcome, gentle\nsignior.\nWe lacked your counsel and your help tonight.\n\nBRABANTIO\nSo did I yours. Good your Grace, pardon me.\nNeither my place nor aught I heard of business\nHath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general\ncare\nTake hold on me, for my particular grief\nIs of so floodgate and o'erbearing nature\nThat it engluts and swallows other sorrows\nAnd it is still itself.\n\nDUKE  Why, what's the matter?\n\nBRABANTIO\nMy daughter! O, my daughter!\n\nFIRST SENATOR  Dead?\n\nBRABANTIO  Ay, to me.\nShe is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted\nBy spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;\nFor nature so prepost'rously to err--\nBeing not deficient, blind, or lame of sense--\nSans witchcraft could not.\n\nDUKE\nWhoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding\nHath thus beguiled your daughter of herself\nAnd you of her, the bloody book of law\nYou shall yourself read in the bitter letter,\nAfter your own sense, yea, though our proper son\nStood in your action.\n\nBRABANTIO  Humbly I thank your Grace.\nHere is the man--this Moor, whom now it seems\nYour special mandate for the state affairs\nHath hither brought.\n\nALL  We are very sorry for 't.\n\nDUKE, [to Othello]\nWhat, in your own part, can you say to this?\n\nBRABANTIO  Nothing, but this is so.\n\nOTHELLO\nMost potent, grave, and reverend signiors,\nMy very noble and approved good masters:\nThat I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,\nIt is most true; true I have married her.\nThe very head and front of my offending\nHath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,\nAnd little blessed with the soft phrase of peace;\nFor since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,\nTill now some nine moons wasted, they have used\nTheir dearest action in the tented field,\nAnd little of this great world can I speak\nMore than pertains to feats of broil and battle.\nAnd therefore little shall I grace my cause\nIn speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious\npatience,\nI will a round unvarnished tale deliver\nOf my whole course of love--what drugs, what\ncharms,\nWhat conjuration, and what mighty magic\n(For such proceeding I am charged withal)\nI won his daughter.\n\nBRABANTIO  A maiden never bold,\nOf spirit so still and quiet that her motion\nBlushed at herself. And she, in spite of nature,\nOf years, of country, credit, everything,\nTo fall in love with what she feared to look on!\nIt is a judgment maimed and most imperfect\nThat will confess perfection so could err\nAgainst all rules of nature, and must be driven\nTo find out practices of cunning hell\nWhy this should be. I therefore vouch again\nThat with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,\nOr with some dram conjured to this effect,\nHe wrought upon her.\n\nDUKE  To vouch this is no proof\nWithout more wider and more overt test\nThan these thin habits and poor likelihoods\nOf modern seeming do prefer against him.\n\nFIRST SENATOR  But, Othello, speak:\nDid you by indirect and forced courses\nSubdue and poison this young maid's affections?\nOr came it by request, and such fair question\nAs soul to soul affordeth?\n\nOTHELLO  I do beseech you,\nSend for the lady to the Sagittary\nAnd let her speak of me before her father.\nIf you do find me foul in her report,\nThe trust, the office I do hold of you,\nNot only take away, but let your sentence\nEven fall upon my life.\n\nDUKE  Fetch Desdemona hither.\n\nOTHELLO\nAncient, conduct them. You best know the place.\n[Iago and Attendants exit.]\nAnd till she come, as truly as to heaven\nI do confess the vices of my blood,\nSo justly to your grave ears I'll present\nHow I did thrive in this fair lady's love,\nAnd she in mine.\n\nDUKE  Say it, Othello.\n\nOTHELLO\nHer father loved me, oft invited me,\nStill questioned me the story of my life\nFrom year to year--the battles, sieges, fortunes\nThat I have passed.\nI ran it through, even from my boyish days\nTo th' very moment that he bade me tell it,\nWherein I spoke of most disastrous chances:\nOf moving accidents by flood and field,\nOf hairbreadth 'scapes i' th' imminent deadly\nbreach,\nOf being taken by the insolent foe\nAnd sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,\nAnd portance in my traveler's history,\nWherein of antres vast and deserts idle,\nRough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads\ntouch heaven,\nIt was my hint to speak--such was my process--\nAnd of the cannibals that each other eat,\nThe Anthropophagi, and men whose heads\nDo grow beneath their shoulders. These things to\nhear\nWould Desdemona seriously incline.\nBut still the house affairs would draw her thence,\nWhich ever as she could with haste dispatch\nShe'd come again, and with a greedy ear\nDevour up my discourse. Which I, observing,\nTook once a pliant hour, and found good means\nTo draw from her a prayer of earnest heart\nThat I would all my pilgrimage dilate,\nWhereof by parcels she had something heard,\nBut not intentively. I did consent,\nAnd often did beguile her of her tears\nWhen I did speak of some distressful stroke\nThat my youth suffered. My story being done,\nShe gave me for my pains a world of sighs.\nShe swore, in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing\nstrange,\n'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful.\nShe wished she had not heard it, yet she wished\nThat heaven had made her such a man. She thanked\nme,\nAnd bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,\nI should but teach him how to tell my story,\nAnd that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake.\nShe loved me for the dangers I had passed,\nAnd I loved her that she did pity them.\nThis only is the witchcraft I have used.\nHere comes the lady. Let her witness it.\n\n[Enter Desdemona, Iago, Attendants.]\n\n\nDUKE\nI think this tale would win my daughter, too.\nGood Brabantio,\nTake up this mangled matter at the best.\nMen do their broken weapons rather use\nThan their bare hands.\n\nBRABANTIO  I pray you hear her speak.\nIf she confess that she was half the wooer,\nDestruction on my head if my bad blame\nLight on the man.--Come hither, gentle mistress.\nDo you perceive in all this noble company\nWhere most you owe obedience?\n\nDESDEMONA  My noble father,\nI do perceive here a divided duty.\nTo you I am bound for life and education.\nMy life and education both do learn me\nHow to respect you. You are the lord of duty.\nI am hitherto your daughter. But here's my\nhusband.\nAnd so much duty as my mother showed\nTo you, preferring you before her father,\nSo much I challenge that I may profess\nDue to the Moor my lord.\n\nBRABANTIO  God be with you! I have done.\nPlease it your Grace, on to the state affairs.\nI had rather to adopt a child than get it.--\nCome hither, Moor.\nI here do give thee that with all my heart\nWhich, but thou hast already, with all my heart\nI would keep from thee.--For your sake, jewel,\nI am glad at soul I have no other child,\nFor thy escape would teach me tyranny,\nTo hang clogs on them.--I have done, my lord.\n\nDUKE\nLet me speak like yourself and lay a sentence,\nWhich as a grise or step may help these lovers\nInto your favor.\nWhen remedies are past, the griefs are ended\nBy seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.\nTo mourn a mischief that is past and gone\nIs the next way to draw new mischief on.\nWhat cannot be preserved when fortune takes,\nPatience her injury a mock'ry makes.\nThe robbed that smiles steals something from the\nthief;\nHe robs himself that spends a bootless grief.\n\nBRABANTIO\nSo let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile,\nWe lose it not so long as we can smile.\nHe bears the sentence well that nothing bears\nBut the free comfort which from thence he hears;\nBut he bears both the sentence and the sorrow\nThat, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.\nThese sentences to sugar or to gall,\nBeing strong on both sides, are equivocal.\nBut words are words. I never yet did hear\nThat the bruised heart was pierced through the\near.\nI humbly beseech you, proceed to th' affairs of\nstate.\n\nDUKE  The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes\nfor Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is\nbest known to you. And though we have there a\nsubstitute of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a\nsovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer\nvoice on you. You must therefore be content to\nslubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this\nmore stubborn and boist'rous expedition.\n\nOTHELLO\nThe tyrant custom, most grave senators,\nHath made the flinty and steel couch of war\nMy thrice-driven bed of down. I do agnize\nA natural and prompt alacrity\nI find in hardness, and do undertake\nThis present wars against the Ottomites.\nMost humbly, therefore, bending to your state,\nI crave fit disposition for my wife,\nDue reference of place and exhibition,\nWith such accommodation and besort\nAs levels with her breeding.\n\nDUKE\nWhy, at her father's.\n\nBRABANTIO  I will not have it so.\n\nOTHELLO  Nor I.\n\nDESDEMONA  Nor would I there reside\nTo put my father in impatient thoughts\nBy being in his eye. Most gracious duke,\nTo my unfolding lend your prosperous ear\nAnd let me find a charter in your voice\nT' assist my simpleness.\n\nDUKE  What would you, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA\nThat I love the Moor to live with him\nMy downright violence and storm of fortunes\nMay trumpet to the world. My heart's subdued\nEven to the very quality of my lord.\nI saw Othello's visage in his mind,\nAnd to his honors and his valiant parts\nDid I my soul and fortunes consecrate.\nSo that, dear lords, if I be left behind,\nA moth of peace, and he go to the war,\nThe rites for why I love him are bereft me\nAnd I a heavy interim shall support\nBy his dear absence. Let me go with him.\n\nOTHELLO  Let her have your voice.\nVouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not\nTo please the palate of my appetite,\nNor to comply with heat (the young affects\nIn me defunct) and proper satisfaction,\nBut to be free and bounteous to her mind.\nAnd heaven defend your good souls that you think\nI will your serious and great business scant\nFor she is with me. No, when light-winged toys\nOf feathered Cupid seel with wanton dullness\nMy speculative and officed instruments,\nThat my disports corrupt and taint my business,\nLet housewives make a skillet of my helm,\nAnd all indign and base adversities\nMake head against my estimation.\n\nDUKE\nBe it as you shall privately determine,\nEither for her stay or going. Th' affair cries haste,\nAnd speed must answer it.\n\nFIRST SENATOR\nYou must away tonight.\n\nOTHELLO  With all my\nheart.\n\nDUKE\nAt nine i' th' morning here we'll meet again.\nOthello, leave some officer behind\nAnd he shall our commission bring to you,\nWith such things else of quality and respect\nAs doth import you.\n\nOTHELLO  So please your Grace, my\nancient.\nA man he is of honesty and trust.\nTo his conveyance I assign my wife,\nWith what else needful your good Grace shall think\nTo be sent after me.\n\nDUKE  Let it be so.\nGood night to everyone. [To Brabantio.] And, noble\nsignior,\nIf virtue no delighted beauty lack,\nYour son-in-law is far more fair than black.\n\nFIRST SENATOR\nAdieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.\n\nBRABANTIO\nLook to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see.\nShe has deceived her father, and may thee.\t[He exits.]\n\nOTHELLO\nMy life upon her faith!\n[The Duke, the Senators, Cassio, and Officers exit.]\nHonest Iago,\nMy Desdemona must I leave to thee.\nI prithee let thy wife attend on her,\nAnd bring them after in the best advantage.--\nCome, Desdemona, I have but an hour\nOf love, of worldly matters, and direction\nTo spend with thee. We must obey the time.\n[Othello and Desdemona exit.]\n\nRODERIGO  Iago--\n\nIAGO  What sayst thou, noble heart?\n\nRODERIGO  What will I do, think'st thou?\n\nIAGO  Why, go to bed and sleep.\n\nRODERIGO  I will incontinently drown myself.\n\nIAGO  If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,\nthou silly gentleman!\n\nRODERIGO  It is silliness to live, when to live is torment,\nand then have we a prescription to die when death is\nour physician.\n\nIAGO  O, villainous! I have looked upon the world for\nfour times seven years, and since I could distinguish\nbetwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found\nman that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say\nI would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I\nwould change my humanity with a baboon.\n\nRODERIGO  What should I do? I confess it is my shame\nto be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.\n\nIAGO  Virtue? A fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or\nthus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our\nwills are gardeners. So that if we will plant nettles\nor sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up thyme,\nsupply it with one gender of herbs or distract it\nwith many, either to have it sterile with idleness or\nmanured with industry, why the power and corrigible\nauthority of this lies in our wills. If the balance\nof our lives had not one scale of reason to poise\nanother of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our\nnatures would conduct us to most prepost'rous\nconclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging\nmotions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts--\nwhereof I take this that you call love to be a sect, or\nscion.\n\nRODERIGO  It cannot be.\n\nIAGO  It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission\nof the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown\ncats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy\nfriend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving\nwith cables of perdurable toughness. I could never\nbetter stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse.\nFollow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an\nusurped beard. I say, put money in thy purse. It\ncannot be that Desdemona should long continue\nher love to the Moor--put money in thy purse--\nnor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in\nher, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration\n--put but money in thy purse. These Moors are\nchangeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money.\nThe food that to him now is as luscious as locusts\nshall be to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.\nShe must change for youth. When she is sated\nwith his body she will find the error of her choice.\nTherefore, put money in thy purse. If thou wilt\nneeds damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than\ndrowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony\nand a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian\nand a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my\nwits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her.\nTherefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself!\nIt is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be\nhanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned\nand go without her.\n\nRODERIGO  Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on\nthe issue?\n\nIAGO  Thou art sure of me. Go, make money. I have\ntold thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I\nhate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no\nless reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge\nagainst him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost\nthyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many\nevents in the womb of time which will be delivered.\nTraverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more\nof this tomorrow. Adieu.\n\nRODERIGO  Where shall we meet i' th' morning?\n\nIAGO  At my lodging.\n\nRODERIGO  I'll be with thee betimes.\n\nIAGO  Go to, farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO  What say you?\n\nIAGO  No more of drowning, do you hear?\n\nRODERIGO  I am changed.\n\nIAGO  Go to, farewell. Put money enough in your\npurse.\n\nRODERIGO  I'll sell all my land.\t[He exits.]\n\nIAGO\nThus do I ever make my fool my purse.\nFor I mine own gained knowledge should profane\nIf I would time expend with such a snipe\nBut for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor,\nAnd it is thought abroad that 'twixt my sheets\n'Has done my office. I know not if 't be true,\nBut I, for mere suspicion in that kind,\nWill do as if for surety. He holds me well.\nThe better shall my purpose work on him.\nCassio's a proper man. Let me see now:\nTo get his place and to plume up my will\nIn double knavery--How? how?--Let's see.\nAfter some time, to abuse Othello's ear\nThat he is too familiar with his wife.\nHe hath a person and a smooth dispose\nTo be suspected, framed to make women false.\nThe Moor is of a free and open nature\nThat thinks men honest that but seem to be so,\nAnd will as tenderly be led by th' nose\nAs asses are.\nI have 't. It is engendered. Hell and night\nMust bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.\n[He exits.]\n\n\nACT 2\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Montano and two Gentlemen.]\n\n\nMONTANO\nWhat from the cape can you discern at sea?\n\nFIRST GENTLEMAN\nNothing at all. It is a high-wrought flood.\nI cannot 'twixt the heaven and the main\nDescry a sail.\n\nMONTANO\nMethinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land.\nA fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements.\nIf it hath ruffianed so upon the sea,\nWhat ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,\nCan hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN\nA segregation of the Turkish fleet.\nFor do but stand upon the foaming shore,\nThe chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds,\nThe wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous\nmane,\nSeems to cast water on the burning Bear\nAnd quench the guards of th' ever-fixed pole.\nI never did like molestation view\nOn the enchafed flood.\n\nMONTANO  If that the Turkish fleet\nBe not ensheltered and embayed, they are drowned.\nIt is impossible to bear it out.\n\n[Enter a third Gentleman.]\n\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN  News, lads! Our wars are done.\nThe desperate tempest hath so banged the Turks\nThat their designment halts. A noble ship of Venice\nHath seen a grievous wrack and sufferance\nOn most part of their fleet.\n\nMONTANO\nHow? Is this true?\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN  The ship is here put in,\nA Veronesa. Michael Cassio,\nLieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,\nIs come on shore; the Moor himself at sea,\nAnd is in full commission here for Cyprus.\n\nMONTANO\nI am glad on 't. 'Tis a worthy governor.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN\nBut this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort\nTouching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly\nAnd prays the Moor be safe, for they were parted\nWith foul and violent tempest.\n\nMONTANO  Pray heaven he be;\nFor I have served him, and the man commands\nLike a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!\nAs well to see the vessel that's come in\nAs to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,\nEven till we make the main and th' aerial blue\nAn indistinct regard.\n\nTHIRD GENTLEMAN  Come, let's do so;\nFor every minute is expectancy\nOf more arrivance.\n\n[Enter Cassio.]\n\n\nCASSIO\nThanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,\nThat so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens\nGive him defense against the elements,\nFor I have lost him on a dangerous sea.\n\nMONTANO  Is he well shipped?\n\nCASSIO\nHis bark is stoutly timbered, and his pilot\nOf very expert and approved allowance;\nTherefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,\nStand in bold cure.\n[Voices cry within. \"A sail, a sail, a sail!\"]\n\n[Enter a Messenger.]\n\n\nCASSIO  What noise?\n\nMESSENGER\nThe town is empty; on the brow o' th' sea\nStand ranks of people, and they cry \"A sail!\"\n\nCASSIO\nMy hopes do shape him for the Governor.\n[A shot.]\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN\nThey do discharge their shot of courtesy.\nOur friends, at least.\n\nCASSIO  I pray you, sir, go forth,\nAnd give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN  I shall.\t[He exits.]\n\nMONTANO\nBut, good lieutenant, is your general wived?\n\nCASSIO\nMost fortunately. He hath achieved a maid\nThat paragons description and wild fame,\nOne that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,\nAnd in th' essential vesture of creation\nDoes tire the ingener.\n\n[Enter Second Gentleman.]\n\nHow now? Who has put in?\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN\n'Tis one Iago, ancient to the General.\n\nCASSIO\n'Has had most favorable and happy speed!\nTempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,\nThe guttered rocks and congregated sands\n(Traitors ensteeped to clog the guiltless keel),\nAs having sense of beauty, do omit\nTheir mortal natures, letting go safely by\nThe divine Desdemona.\n\nMONTANO  What is she?\n\nCASSIO\nShe that I spake of, our great captain's captain,\nLeft in the conduct of the bold Iago,\nWhose footing here anticipates our thoughts\nA sennight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,\nAnd swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,\nThat he may bless this bay with his tall ship,\nMake love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,\nGive renewed fire to our extincted spirits,\nAnd bring all Cyprus comfort!\n\n[Enter Desdemona, Iago, Roderigo, and Emilia.]\n\nO, behold,\nThe riches of the ship is come on shore!\nYou men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.\n[He kneels.]\nHail to thee, lady, and the grace of heaven,\nBefore, behind thee, and on every hand\nEnwheel thee round.\t[He rises.]\n\nDESDEMONA  I thank you, valiant Cassio.\nWhat tidings can you tell of my lord?\n\nCASSIO\nHe is not yet arrived, nor know I aught\nBut that he's well and will be shortly here.\n\nDESDEMONA\nO, but I fear--How lost you company?\n\nCASSIO\nThe great contention of sea and skies\nParted our fellowship.\n[Within \"A sail, a sail!\" A shot.]\nBut hark, a sail!\n\nSECOND GENTLEMAN\nThey give their greeting to the citadel.\nThis likewise is a friend.\n\nCASSIO  See for the news.\n[Second Gentleman exits.]\nGood ancient, you are welcome. Welcome, mistress.\n[He kisses Emilia.]\nLet it not gall your patience, good Iago,\nThat I extend my manners. 'Tis my breeding\nThat gives me this bold show of courtesy.\n\nIAGO\nSir, would she give you so much of her lips\nAs of her tongue she oft bestows on me,\nYou would have enough.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAlas, she has no speech!\n\nIAGO  In faith, too much.\nI find it still when I have list to sleep.\nMarry, before your Ladyship, I grant,\nShe puts her tongue a little in her heart\nAnd chides with thinking.\n\nEMILIA  You have little cause to say so.\n\nIAGO  Come on, come on! You are pictures out of door,\nbells in your parlors, wildcats in your kitchens,\nsaints in your injuries, devils being offended, players\nin your huswifery, and huswives in your beds.\n\nDESDEMONA  Oh, fie upon thee, slanderer.\n\nIAGO\nNay, it is true, or else I am a Turk.\nYou rise to play, and go to bed to work.\n\nEMILIA\nYou shall not write my praise.\n\nIAGO  No, let me not.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhat wouldst write of me if thou shouldst praise\nme?\n\nIAGO\nO, gentle lady, do not put me to 't,\nFor I am nothing if not critical.\n\nDESDEMONA\nCome on, assay.--There's one gone to the harbor?\n\nIAGO  Ay, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA, [aside]\nI am not merry, but I do beguile\nThe thing I am by seeming otherwise.--\nCome, how wouldst thou praise me?\n\nIAGO  I am about it, but indeed my invention comes\nfrom my pate as birdlime does from frieze: it\nplucks out brains and all. But my muse labors, and\nthus she is delivered:\n\tIf she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,\n\tThe one's for use, the other useth it.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWell praised! How if she be black and witty?\n\nIAGO\n\tIf she be black, and thereto have a wit,\n\tShe'll find a white that shall her blackness hit.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWorse and worse.\n\nEMILIA  How if fair and foolish?\n\nIAGO\n\tShe never yet was foolish that was fair,\n\tFor even her folly helped her to an heir.\n\nDESDEMONA  These are old fond paradoxes to make\nfools laugh i' th' alehouse. What miserable praise\nhast thou for her that's foul and foolish?\n\nIAGO\n\tThere's none so foul and foolish thereunto,\n\tBut does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.\n\nDESDEMONA  O heavy ignorance! Thou praisest the\nworst best. But what praise couldst thou bestow on\na deserving woman indeed, one that in the authority\nof her merit did justly put on the vouch of very\nmalice itself?\n\nIAGO\n\tShe that was ever fair and never proud,\n\tHad tongue at will and yet was never loud,\n\tNever lacked gold and yet went never gay,\n\tFled from her wish, and yet said \"Now I may,\"\n\tShe that being angered, her revenge being nigh,\n\tBade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,\n\tShe that in wisdom never was so frail\n\tTo change the cod's head for the salmon's tail,\n\tShe that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,\n\tSee suitors following and not look behind,\n\tShe was a wight, if ever such wight were--\n\nDESDEMONA  To do what?\n\nIAGO\n\tTo suckle fools and chronicle small beer.\n\nDESDEMONA  O, most lame and impotent conclusion!\n--Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy\nhusband.--How say you, Cassio? Is he not a most\nprofane and liberal counselor?\n\nCASSIO  He speaks home, madam. You may relish him\nmore in the soldier than in the scholar.\n[Cassio takes Desdemona's hand.]\n\nIAGO, [aside]  He takes her by the palm. Ay, well said,\nwhisper. With as little a web as this will I ensnare as\ngreat a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon her, do. I will\ngyve thee in thine own courtship. You say true, 'tis\nso indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of\nyour lieutenantry, it had been better you had not\nkissed your three fingers so oft, which now again\nyou are most apt to play the sir in. Very good; well\nkissed; an excellent courtesy! 'Tis so, indeed. Yet\nagain your fingers to your lips? Would they were\nclyster pipes for your sake!\t[Trumpets within.]\nThe Moor. I know his trumpet.\n\nCASSIO  'Tis truly so.\n\nDESDEMONA  Let's meet him and receive him.\n\nCASSIO  Lo, where he comes!\n\n[Enter Othello and Attendants.]\n\n\nOTHELLO\nO, my fair warrior!\n\nDESDEMONA  My dear Othello!\n\nOTHELLO\nIt gives me wonder great as my content\nTo see you here before me. O my soul's joy!\nIf after every tempest come such calms,\nMay the winds blow till they have wakened death,\nAnd let the laboring bark climb hills of seas\nOlympus high, and duck again as low\nAs hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,\n'Twere now to be most happy, for I fear\nMy soul hath her content so absolute\nThat not another comfort like to this\nSucceeds in unknown fate.\n\nDESDEMONA  The heavens forbid\nBut that our loves and comforts should increase\nEven as our days do grow!\n\nOTHELLO  Amen to that, sweet powers!\nI cannot speak enough of this content.\nIt stops me here; it is too much of joy.\t[They kiss.]\nAnd this, and this, the greatest discords be\nThat e'er our hearts shall make!\n\nIAGO, [aside]  O, you are well tuned now,\nBut I'll set down the pegs that make this music,\nAs honest as I am.\n\nOTHELLO  Come. Let us to the castle.--\nNews, friends! Our wars are done. The Turks are\ndrowned.\nHow does my old acquaintance of this isle?--\nHoney, you shall be well desired in Cyprus.\nI have found great love amongst them. O, my sweet,\nI prattle out of fashion, and I dote\nIn mine own comforts.--I prithee, good Iago,\nGo to the bay and disembark my coffers.\nBring thou the master to the citadel.\nHe is a good one, and his worthiness\nDoes challenge much respect.--Come, Desdemona.\nOnce more, well met at Cyprus.\n[All but Iago and Roderigo exit.]\n\nIAGO, [to a departing Attendant]  Do thou meet me presently\nat the harbor. [To Roderigo.] Come hither. If\nthou be'st valiant--as they say base men being in\nlove have then a nobility in their natures more than\nis native to them--list me. The Lieutenant tonight\nwatches on the court of guard. First, I must tell thee\nthis: Desdemona is directly in love with him.\n\nRODERIGO  With him? Why, 'tis not possible.\n\nIAGO  Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.\nMark me with what violence she first loved the\nMoor but for bragging and telling her fantastical\nlies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not\nthy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And\nwhat delight shall she have to look on the devil?\nWhen the blood is made dull with the act of sport,\nthere should be, again to inflame it and to give\nsatiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy\nin years, manners, and beauties, all which the Moor\nis defective in. Now, for want of these required\nconveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself\nabused, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and\nabhor the Moor. Very nature will instruct her in it\nand compel her to some second choice. Now, sir,\nthis granted--as it is a most pregnant and unforced\nposition--who stands so eminent in the degree of\nthis fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble, no\nfurther conscionable than in putting on the mere\nform of civil and humane seeming for the better\ncompassing of his salt and most hidden loose\naffection. Why, none, why, none! A slipper and\nsubtle knave, a finder-out of occasions, that has an\neye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though\ntrue advantage never present itself; a devilish knave!\nBesides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all\nthose requisites in him that folly and green minds\nlook after. A pestilent complete knave, and the\nwoman hath found him already.\n\nRODERIGO  I cannot believe that in her. She's full of\nmost blessed condition.\n\nIAGO  Blessed fig's end! The wine she drinks is made of\ngrapes. If she had been blessed, she would never\nhave loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou\nnot see her paddle with the palm of his hand? Didst\nnot mark that?\n\nRODERIGO  Yes, that I did. But that was but courtesy.\n\nIAGO  Lechery, by this hand! An index and obscure\nprologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts.\nThey met so near with their lips that their breaths\nembraced together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo!\nWhen these mutualities so marshal the way, hard\nat hand comes the master and main exercise, th'\nincorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you ruled\nby me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you\ntonight. For the command, I'll lay 't upon you.\nCassio knows you not. I'll not be far from you. Do\nyou find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by\nspeaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from\nwhat other course you please, which the time shall\nmore favorably minister.\n\nRODERIGO  Well.\n\nIAGO  Sir, he's rash and very sudden in choler, and\nhaply may strike at you. Provoke him that he may,\nfor even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to\nmutiny, whose qualification shall come into no\ntrue taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So\nshall you have a shorter journey to your desires by\nthe means I shall then have to prefer them, and the\nimpediment most profitably removed, without the\nwhich there were no expectation of our prosperity.\n\nRODERIGO  I will do this, if you can bring it to any\nopportunity.\n\nIAGO  I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel. I\nmust fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.\n\nRODERIGO  Adieu.\t[He exits.]\n\nIAGO\nThat Cassio loves her, I do well believe 't.\nThat she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit.\nThe Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,\nIs of a constant, loving, noble nature,\nAnd I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona\nA most dear husband. Now, I do love her too,\nNot out of absolute lust (though peradventure\nI stand accountant for as great a sin)\nBut partly led to diet my revenge\nFor that I do suspect the lusty Moor\nHath leaped into my seat--the thought whereof\nDoth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards,\nAnd nothing can or shall content my soul\nTill I am evened with him, wife for wife,\nOr, failing so, yet that I put the Moor\nAt least into a jealousy so strong\nThat judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,\nIf this poor trash of Venice, whom I trace\nFor his quick hunting, stand the putting on,\nI'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,\nAbuse him to the Moor in the rank garb\n(For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too),\nMake the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me\nFor making him egregiously an ass\nAnd practicing upon his peace and quiet\nEven to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused.\nKnavery's plain face is never seen till used.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Othello's Herald with a proclamation.]\n\n\nHERALD  It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant\ngeneral, that upon certain tidings now arrived,\nimporting the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,\nevery man put himself into triumph: some to\ndance, some to make bonfires, each man to what\nsport and revels his addition leads him. For besides\nthese beneficial news, it is the celebration of his\nnuptial. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed\nAll offices are open, and there is full\nliberty of feasting from this present hour of five till\nthe bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the isle of\nCyprus and our noble general, Othello!\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Attendants.]\n\n\nOTHELLO\nGood Michael, look you to the guard tonight.\nLet's teach ourselves that honorable stop\nNot to outsport discretion.\n\nCASSIO\nIago hath direction what to do,\nBut notwithstanding, with my personal eye\nWill I look to 't.\n\nOTHELLO  Iago is most honest.\nMichael, goodnight. Tomorrow with your earliest\nLet me have speech with you. [To Desdemona.] Come,\nmy dear love,\nThe purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;\nThat profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.--\nGoodnight.\n[Othello and Desdemona exit, with Attendants.]\n\n[Enter Iago.]\n\n\nCASSIO\nWelcome, Iago. We must to the watch.\n\nIAGO  Not this hour, lieutenant. 'Tis not yet ten o' th'\nclock. Our general cast us thus early for the love of\nhis Desdemona--who let us not therefore blame;\nhe hath not yet made wanton the night with her, and\nshe is sport for Jove.\n\nCASSIO  She's a most exquisite lady.\n\nIAGO  And, I'll warrant her, full of game.\n\nCASSIO  Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate\ncreature.\n\nIAGO  What an eye she has! Methinks it sounds a parley\nto provocation.\n\nCASSIO  An inviting eye, and yet methinks right\nmodest.\n\nIAGO  And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?\n\nCASSIO  She is indeed perfection.\n\nIAGO  Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant,\nI have a stoup of wine; and here without are a\nbrace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a\nmeasure to the health of black Othello.\n\nCASSIO  Not tonight, good Iago. I have very poor and\nunhappy brains for drinking. I could well wish\ncourtesy would invent some other custom of\nentertainment.\n\nIAGO  O, they are our friends! But one cup; I'll drink\nfor you.\n\nCASSIO  I have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was\ncraftily qualified too, and behold what innovation it\nmakes here. I am unfortunate in the infirmity and\ndare not task my weakness with any more.\n\nIAGO  What, man! 'Tis a night of revels. The gallants\ndesire it.\n\nCASSIO  Where are they?\n\nIAGO  Here at the door. I pray you, call them in.\n\nCASSIO  I'll do 't, but it dislikes me.\t[He exits.]\n\nIAGO\nIf I can fasten but one cup upon him\nWith that which he hath drunk tonight already,\nHe'll be as full of quarrel and offense\nAs my young mistress' dog. Now my sick fool\nRoderigo,\nWhom love hath turned almost the wrong side out,\nTo Desdemona hath tonight caroused\nPotations pottle-deep; and he's to watch.\nThree else of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits\nThat hold their honors in a wary distance,\nThe very elements of this warlike isle,\nHave I tonight flustered with flowing cups;\nAnd they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of\ndrunkards\nAm I to put our Cassio in some action\nThat may offend the isle. But here they come.\nIf consequence do but approve my dream,\nMy boat sails freely both with wind and stream.\n\n[Enter Cassio, Montano, and Gentlemen, followed by\nServants with wine.]\n\n\nCASSIO  'Fore God, they have given me a rouse\nalready.\n\nMONTANO  Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I\nam a soldier.\n\nIAGO  Some wine, ho!\n[Sings.]\tAnd let me the cannikin clink, clink,\n\tAnd let me the cannikin clink.\n\t   A soldier's a man,\n\t   O, man's life's but a span,\n\tWhy, then, let a soldier drink.\nSome wine, boys!\n\nCASSIO  'Fore God, an excellent song.\n\nIAGO  I learned it in England, where indeed they are\nmost potent in potting. Your Dane, your German,\nand your swag-bellied Hollander--drink, ho!--are\nnothing to your English.\n\nCASSIO  Is your Englishman so exquisite in his\ndrinking?\n\nIAGO  Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane\ndead drunk. He sweats not to overthrow your Almain.\nHe gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next\npottle can be filled.\n\nCASSIO  To the health of our general!\n\nMONTANO  I am for it, lieutenant, and I'll do you\njustice.\n\nIAGO  O sweet England!\n[Sings.]\tKing Stephen was and-a worthy peer,\n\t   His breeches cost him but a crown;\n\tHe held them sixpence all too dear;\n\t   With that he called the tailor lown.\n\tHe was a wight of high renown,\n\t   And thou art but of low degree;\n\t'Tis pride that pulls the country down,\n\t   Then take thy auld cloak about thee.\nSome wine, ho!\n\nCASSIO  'Fore God, this is a more exquisite song than\nthe other!\n\nIAGO  Will you hear 't again?\n\nCASSIO  No, for I hold him to be unworthy of his place\nthat does those things. Well, God's above all; and\nthere be souls must be saved, and there be souls\nmust not be saved.\n\nIAGO  It's true, good lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO  For mine own part--no offense to the General,\nnor any man of quality--I hope to be saved.\n\nIAGO  And so do I too, lieutenant.\n\nCASSIO  Ay, but, by your leave, not before me. The\nLieutenant is to be saved before the Ancient. Let's\nhave no more of this. Let's to our affairs. God\nforgive us our sins! Gentlemen, let's look to our\nbusiness. Do not think, gentlemen, I am drunk. This\nis my ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my\nleft. I am not drunk now. I can stand well enough,\nand I speak well enough.\n\nGENTLEMEN  Excellent well.\n\nCASSIO  Why, very well then. You must not think then\nthat I am drunk.\t[He exits.]\n\nMONTANO\nTo th' platform, masters. Come, let's set the watch.\n[Gentlemen exit.]\n\nIAGO, [to Montano]\nYou see this fellow that is gone before?\nHe's a soldier fit to stand by Caesar\nAnd give direction; and do but see his vice.\n'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,\nThe one as long as th' other. 'Tis pity of him.\nI fear the trust Othello puts him in,\nOn some odd time of his infirmity,\nWill shake this island.\n\nMONTANO  But is he often thus?\n\nIAGO\n'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep.\nHe'll watch the horologe a double set\nIf drink rock not his cradle.\n\nMONTANO  It were well\nThe General were put in mind of it.\nPerhaps he sees it not, or his good nature\nPrizes the virtue that appears in Cassio\nAnd looks not on his evils. Is not this true?\n\n[Enter Roderigo.]\n\n\nIAGO, [aside to Roderigo]  How now, Roderigo?\nI pray you, after the Lieutenant, go.\n[Roderigo exits.]\n\nMONTANO\nAnd 'tis great pity that the noble Moor\nShould hazard such a place as his own second\nWith one of an engraffed infirmity.\nIt were an honest action to say so\nTo the Moor.\n\nIAGO  Not I, for this fair island.\nI do love Cassio well and would do much\nTo cure him of this evil--\t[\"Help, help!\" within.]\nBut hark! What noise?\n\n[Enter Cassio, pursuing Roderigo.]\n\n\nCASSIO  Zounds, you rogue, you rascal!\n\nMONTANO  What's the matter, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO  A knave teach me my duty? I'll beat the knave\ninto a twiggen bottle.\n\nRODERIGO  Beat me?\n\nCASSIO  Dost thou prate, rogue?\t[He hits Roderigo.]\n\nMONTANO  Nay, good lieutenant. I pray you, sir, hold\nyour hand.\n\nCASSIO  Let me go, sir, or I'll knock you o'er the\nmazard.\n\nMONTANO  Come, come, you're drunk.\n\nCASSIO  Drunk?\n[They fight.]\n\nIAGO, [aside to Roderigo]\nAway, I say! Go out and cry a mutiny.\n[Roderigo exits.]\nNay, good lieutenant.--God's will, gentlemen!--\nHelp, ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--sir--\nHelp, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!\n[A bell is rung.]\nWho's that which rings the bell? Diablo, ho!\nThe town will rise. God's will, lieutenant, hold!\nYou will be shamed forever.\n\n[Enter Othello and Attendants.]\n\n\nOTHELLO\nWhat is the matter here?\n\nMONTANO  Zounds, I bleed\nstill.\nI am hurt to th' death. He dies!\t[He attacks Cassio.]\n\nOTHELLO  Hold, for your lives!\n\nIAGO\nHold, ho! Lieutenant--sir--Montano--\ngentlemen--\nHave you forgot all sense of place and duty?\nHold! The General speaks to you. Hold, for shame!\n\nOTHELLO\nWhy, how now, ho! From whence ariseth this?\nAre we turned Turks, and to ourselves do that\nWhich heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?\nFor Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl!\nHe that stirs next to carve for his own rage\nHolds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.\nSilence that dreadful bell. It frights the isle\nFrom her propriety. What is the matter, masters?\nHonest Iago, that looks dead with grieving,\nSpeak. Who began this? On thy love, I charge thee.\n\nIAGO\nI do not know. Friends all but now, even now,\nIn quarter and in terms like bride and groom\nDivesting them for bed; and then but now,\nAs if some planet had unwitted men,\nSwords out, and tilting one at other's breast,\nIn opposition bloody. I cannot speak\nAny beginning to this peevish odds,\nAnd would in action glorious I had lost\nThose legs that brought me to a part of it!\n\nOTHELLO\nHow comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?\n\nCASSIO\nI pray you pardon me; I cannot speak.\n\nOTHELLO\nWorthy Montano, you were wont be civil.\nThe gravity and stillness of your youth\nThe world hath noted. And your name is great\nIn mouths of wisest censure. What's the matter\nThat you unlace your reputation thus,\nAnd spend your rich opinion for the name\nOf a night-brawler? Give me answer to it.\n\nMONTANO\nWorthy Othello, I am hurt to danger.\nYour officer Iago can inform you,\nWhile I spare speech, which something now offends\nme,\nOf all that I do know; nor know I aught\nBy me that's said or done amiss this night,\nUnless self-charity be sometimes a vice,\nAnd to defend ourselves it be a sin\nWhen violence assails us.\n\nOTHELLO  Now, by heaven,\nMy blood begins my safer guides to rule,\nAnd passion, having my best judgment collied,\nAssays to lead the way. Zounds, if I stir,\nOr do but lift this arm, the best of you\nShall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know\nHow this foul rout began, who set it on;\nAnd he that is approved in this offense,\nThough he had twinned with me, both at a birth,\nShall lose me. What, in a town of war\nYet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,\nTo manage private and domestic quarrel,\nIn night, and on the court and guard of safety?\n'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began 't?\n\nMONTANO\nIf partially affined, or leagued in office,\nThou dost deliver more or less than truth,\nThou art no soldier.\n\nIAGO  Touch me not so near.\nI had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth\nThan it should do offense to Michael Cassio.\nYet I persuade myself, to speak the truth\nShall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:\nMontano and myself being in speech,\nThere comes a fellow crying out for help,\nAnd Cassio following him with determined sword\nTo execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman\n[Pointing to Montano.]\nSteps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.\nMyself the crying fellow did pursue,\nLest by his clamor--as it so fell out--\nThe town might fall in fright. He, swift of foot,\nOutran my purpose, and I returned the rather\nFor that I heard the clink and fall of swords\nAnd Cassio high in oath, which till tonight\nI ne'er might say before. When I came back--\nFor this was brief--I found them close together\nAt blow and thrust, even as again they were\nWhen you yourself did part them.\nMore of this matter cannot I report.\nBut men are men; the best sometimes forget.\nThough Cassio did some little wrong to him,\nAs men in rage strike those that wish them best,\nYet surely Cassio, I believe, received\nFrom him that fled some strange indignity\nWhich patience could not pass.\n\nOTHELLO  I know, Iago,\nThy honesty and love doth mince this matter,\nMaking it light to Cassio.--Cassio, I love thee,\nBut nevermore be officer of mine.\n\n[Enter Desdemona attended.]\n\nLook if my gentle love be not raised up!\nI'll make thee an example.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhat is the matter, dear?\n\nOTHELLO  All's well now,\nsweeting.\nCome away to bed. [To Montano.] Sir, for your hurts,\nMyself will be your surgeon.--Lead him off.\n[Montano is led off.]\nIago, look with care about the town\nAnd silence those whom this vile brawl\ndistracted.--\nCome, Desdemona. 'Tis the soldier's life\nTo have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.\n[All but Iago and Cassio exit.]\n\nIAGO  What, are you hurt, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO  Ay, past all surgery.\n\nIAGO  Marry, God forbid!\n\nCASSIO  Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have\nlost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of\nmyself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,\nIago, my reputation!\n\nIAGO  As I am an honest man, I thought you had\nreceived some bodily wound. There is more sense\nin that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and\nmost false imposition, oft got without merit and lost\nwithout deserving. You have lost no reputation at\nall, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What,\nman, there are ways to recover the General again!\nYou are but now cast in his mood--a punishment\nmore in policy than in malice, even so as one would\nbeat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious\nlion. Sue to him again and he's yours.\n\nCASSIO  I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive\nso good a commander with so slight, so drunken,\nand so indiscreet an officer. Drunk? And speak\nparrot? And squabble? Swagger? Swear? And discourse\nfustian with one's own shadow? O thou\ninvisible spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be\nknown by, let us call thee devil!\n\nIAGO  What was he that you followed with your sword?\nWhat had he done to you?\n\nCASSIO  I know not.\n\nIAGO  Is 't possible?\n\nCASSIO  I remember a mass of things, but nothing\ndistinctly; a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O\nGod, that men should put an enemy in their\nmouths to steal away their brains! That we should\nwith joy, pleasance, revel, and applause transform\nourselves into beasts!\n\nIAGO  Why, but you are now well enough. How came\nyou thus recovered?\n\nCASSIO  It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give\nplace to the devil wrath. One unperfectness shows\nme another, to make me frankly despise myself.\n\nIAGO  Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time,\nthe place, and the condition of this country stands,\nI could heartily wish this had not so befallen. But\nsince it is as it is, mend it for your own good.\n\nCASSIO  I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell\nme I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as\nHydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be\nnow a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently\na beast! O, strange! Every inordinate cup is unblessed,\nand the ingredient is a devil.\n\nIAGO  Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,\nif it be well used. Exclaim no more against it.\nAnd, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.\n\nCASSIO  I have well approved it, sir.--I drunk!\n\nIAGO  You or any man living may be drunk at a time,\nman. I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's\nwife is now the general: I may say so in this\nrespect, for that he hath devoted and given up\nhimself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement\nof her parts and graces. Confess yourself\nfreely to her. Importune her help to put you in your\nplace again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so\nblessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her\ngoodness not to do more than she is requested. This\nbroken joint between you and her husband entreat\nher to splinter, and, my fortunes against any lay\nworth naming, this crack of your love shall grow\nstronger than it was before.\n\nCASSIO  You advise me well.\n\nIAGO  I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest\nkindness.\n\nCASSIO  I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I\nwill beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake\nfor me. I am desperate of my fortunes if they check\nme here.\n\nIAGO  You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant. I\nmust to the watch.\n\nCASSIO  Good night, honest Iago.\t[Cassio exits.]\n\nIAGO\nAnd what's he, then, that says I play the villain,\nWhen this advice is free I give and honest,\nProbal to thinking, and indeed the course\nTo win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy\nTh' inclining Desdemona to subdue\nIn any honest suit. She's framed as fruitful\nAs the free elements. And then for her\nTo win the Moor--were 't to renounce his baptism,\nAll seals and symbols of redeemed sin--\nHis soul is so enfettered to her love\nThat she may make, unmake, do what she list,\nEven as her appetite shall play the god\nWith his weak function. How am I then a villain\nTo counsel Cassio to this parallel course\nDirectly to his good? Divinity of hell!\nWhen devils will the blackest sins put on,\nThey do suggest at first with heavenly shows,\nAs I do now. For whiles this honest fool\nPlies Desdemona to repair his fortune,\nAnd she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,\nI'll pour this pestilence into his ear:\nThat she repeals him for her body's lust;\nAnd by how much she strives to do him good,\nShe shall undo her credit with the Moor.\nSo will I turn her virtue into pitch,\nAnd out of her own goodness make the net\nThat shall enmesh them all.\n\n[Enter Roderigo.]\n\nHow now, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO  I do follow here in the chase, not like a\nhound that hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My\nmoney is almost spent, I have been tonight exceedingly\nwell cudgeled, and I think the issue will be I\nshall have so much experience for my pains, and so,\nwith no money at all and a little more wit, return\nagain to Venice.\n\nIAGO\nHow poor are they that have not patience!\nWhat wound did ever heal but by degrees?\nThou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft,\nAnd wit depends on dilatory time.\nDoes 't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee,\nAnd thou, by that small hurt, hast cashiered Cassio.\nThough other things grow fair against the sun,\nYet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe.\nContent thyself awhile. By th' Mass, 'tis morning!\nPleasure and action make the hours seem short.\nRetire thee; go where thou art billeted.\nAway, I say! Thou shalt know more hereafter.\nNay, get thee gone.\t[Roderigo exits.]\nTwo things are to be done.\nMy wife must move for Cassio to her mistress.\nI'll set her on.\nMyself the while to draw the Moor apart\nAnd bring him jump when he may Cassio find\nSoliciting his wife. Ay, that's the way.\nDull not device by coldness and delay.\n[He exits.]\n\n\nACT 3\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Cassio with Musicians.]\n\n\nCASSIO\nMasters, play here (I will content your pains)\nSomething that's brief; and bid \"Good morrow,\ngeneral.\"\t[They play.]\n\n[Enter the Clown.]\n\n\nCLOWN  Why masters, have your instruments been in\nNaples, that they speak i' th' nose thus?\n\nMUSICIAN  How, sir, how?\n\nCLOWN  Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?\n\nMUSICIAN  Ay, marry, are they, sir.\n\nCLOWN  O, thereby hangs a tail.\n\nMUSICIAN  Whereby hangs a tale, sir?\n\nCLOWN  Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I\nknow. But, masters, here's money for you; and the\nGeneral so likes your music that he desires you, for\nlove's sake, to make no more noise with it.\n\nMUSICIAN  Well, sir, we will not.\n\nCLOWN  If you have any music that may not be heard, to\n't again. But, as they say, to hear music the General\ndoes not greatly care.\n\nMUSICIAN  We have none such, sir.\n\nCLOWN  Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll\naway. Go, vanish into air, away!\n\n[Musicians exit.]\n\nCASSIO  Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?\n\nCLOWN  No, I hear not your honest friend. I hear you.\n\nCASSIO  Prithee, keep up thy quillets.\t[Giving money.]\nThere's a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman\nthat attends the General's wife be stirring,\ntell her there's one Cassio entreats her a little favor\nof speech. Wilt thou do this?\n\nCLOWN  She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall\nseem to notify unto her.\n\nCASSIO\nDo, good my friend.\t[Clown exits.]\n\n[Enter Iago.]\n\nIn happy time, Iago.\n\nIAGO  You have not been abed, then?\n\nCASSIO  Why, no. The day had broke\nBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,\nTo send in to your wife. My suit to her\nIs that she will to virtuous Desdemona\nProcure me some access.\n\nIAGO  I'll send her to you presently,\nAnd I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor\nOut of the way, that your converse and business\nMay be more free.\n\nCASSIO\nI humbly thank you for 't. [Iago exits.] I never\nknew\nA Florentine more kind and honest.\n\n[Enter Emilia.]\n\n\nEMILIA\nGood morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry\nFor your displeasure, but all will sure be well.\nThe General and his wife are talking of it,\nAnd she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies\nThat he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus\nAnd great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom\nHe might not but refuse you. But he protests he\nloves you\nAnd needs no other suitor but his likings\nTo take the safest occasion by the front\nTo bring you in again.\n\nCASSIO  Yet I beseech you,\nIf you think fit, or that it may be done,\nGive me advantage of some brief discourse\nWith Desdemon alone.\n\nEMILIA  Pray you come in.\nI will bestow you where you shall have time\nTo speak your bosom freely.\n\nCASSIO  I am much bound to you.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.]\n\n\nOTHELLO\nThese letters give, Iago, to the pilot\nAnd by him do my duties to the Senate.\n[He gives Iago some papers.]\nThat done, I will be walking on the works.\nRepair there to me.\n\nIAGO  Well, my good lord, I'll do 't.\n\nOTHELLO\nThis fortification, gentlemen, shall we see 't?\n\nGENTLEMEN\nWe wait upon your Lordship.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.]\n\n\nDESDEMONA\nBe thou assured, good Cassio, I will do\nAll my abilities in thy behalf.\n\nEMILIA\nGood madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband\nAs if the cause were his.\n\nDESDEMONA\nO, that's an honest fellow! Do not doubt, Cassio,\nBut I will have my lord and you again\nAs friendly as you were.\n\nCASSIO  Bounteous madam,\nWhatever shall become of Michael Cassio,\nHe's never anything but your true servant.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI know 't. I thank you. You do love my lord;\nYou have known him long; and be you well assured\nHe shall in strangeness stand no farther off\nThan in a politic distance.\n\nCASSIO  Ay, but, lady,\nThat policy may either last so long,\nOr feed upon such nice and waterish diet,\nOr breed itself so out of circumstance,\nThat, I being absent and my place supplied,\nMy general will forget my love and service.\n\nDESDEMONA\nDo not doubt that. Before Emilia here,\nI give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,\nIf I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it\nTo the last article. My lord shall never rest:\nI'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;\nHis bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;\nI'll intermingle everything he does\nWith Cassio's suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,\nFor thy solicitor shall rather die\nThan give thy cause away.\n\n[Enter Othello and Iago.]\n\n\nEMILIA  Madam, here comes my lord.\n\nCASSIO  Madam, I'll take my leave.\n\nDESDEMONA  Why, stay, and hear me speak.\n\nCASSIO\nMadam, not now. I am very ill at ease,\nUnfit for mine own purposes.\n\nDESDEMONA  Well, do your discretion.\t[Cassio exits.]\n\nIAGO\nHa, I like not that.\n\nOTHELLO  What dost thou say?\n\nIAGO\nNothing, my lord; or if--I know not what.\n\nOTHELLO\nWas not that Cassio parted from my wife?\n\nIAGO\nCassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it\nThat he would steal away so guiltylike,\nSeeing your coming.\n\nOTHELLO  I do believe 'twas he.\n\nDESDEMONA  How now, my lord?\nI have been talking with a suitor here,\nA man that languishes in your displeasure.\n\nOTHELLO  Who is 't you mean?\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhy, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,\nIf I have any grace or power to move you,\nHis present reconciliation take;\nFor if he be not one that truly loves you,\nThat errs in ignorance and not in cunning,\nI have no judgment in an honest face.\nI prithee call him back.\n\nOTHELLO  Went he hence now?\n\nDESDEMONA  Yes, faith, so humbled\nThat he hath left part of his grief with me\nTo suffer with him. Good love, call him back.\n\nOTHELLO\nNot now, sweet Desdemon. Some other time.\n\nDESDEMONA\nBut shall 't be shortly?\n\nOTHELLO  The sooner, sweet, for you.\n\nDESDEMONA\nShall 't be tonight at supper?\n\nOTHELLO  No, not tonight.\n\nDESDEMONA  Tomorrow dinner, then?\n\nOTHELLO  I shall not dine at home;\nI meet the captains at the citadel.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhy then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn,\nOn Tuesday noon or night; on Wednesday morn.\nI prithee name the time, but let it not\nExceed three days. In faith, he's penitent;\nAnd yet his trespass, in our common reason--\nSave that, they say, the wars must make example\nOut of her best--is not almost a fault\nT' incur a private check. When shall he come?\nTell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul\nWhat you would ask me that I should deny,\nOr stand so mamm'ring on? What? Michael Cassio,\nThat came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,\nWhen I have spoke of you dispraisingly,\nHath ta'en your part--to have so much to do\nTo bring him in! By 'r Lady, I could do much--\n\nOTHELLO\nPrithee, no more. Let him come when he will;\nI will deny thee nothing.\n\nDESDEMONA  Why, this is not a boon!\n'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,\nOr feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,\nOr sue to you to do a peculiar profit\nTo your own person. Nay, when I have a suit\nWherein I mean to touch your love indeed,\nIt shall be full of poise and difficult weight,\nAnd fearful to be granted.\n\nOTHELLO  I will deny thee nothing!\nWhereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,\nTo leave me but a little to myself.\n\nDESDEMONA\nShall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO\nFarewell, my Desdemona. I'll come to thee straight.\n\nDESDEMONA\nEmilia, come.--Be as your fancies teach you.\nWhate'er you be, I am obedient.\n[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\n\nOTHELLO\nExcellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul\nBut I do love thee! And when I love thee not,\nChaos is come again.\n\nIAGO  My noble lord--\n\nOTHELLO\nWhat dost thou say, Iago?\n\nIAGO  Did Michael Cassio,\nWhen you wooed my lady, know of your love?\n\nOTHELLO\nHe did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?\n\nIAGO\nBut for a satisfaction of my thought,\nNo further harm.\n\nOTHELLO  Why of thy thought, Iago?\n\nIAGO\nI did not think he had been acquainted with her.\n\nOTHELLO\nO yes, and went between us very oft.\n\nIAGO  Indeed?\n\nOTHELLO\nIndeed? Ay, indeed! Discern'st thou aught in that?\nIs he not honest?\n\nIAGO  Honest, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO  Honest--ay, honest.\n\nIAGO\nMy lord, for aught I know.\n\nOTHELLO  What dost thou think?\n\nIAGO  Think, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\n\"Think, my lord?\" By heaven, thou echo'st me\nAs if there were some monster in thy thought\nToo hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean\nsomething.\nI heard thee say even now, thou lik'st not that,\nWhen Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?\nAnd when I told thee he was of my counsel\nIn my whole course of wooing, thou cried'st\n\"Indeed?\"\nAnd didst contract and purse thy brow together\nAs if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain\nSome horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,\nShow me thy thought.\n\nIAGO  My lord, you know I love you.\n\nOTHELLO  I think thou dost;\nAnd for I know thou 'rt full of love and honesty\nAnd weigh'st thy words before thou giv'st them\nbreath,\nTherefore these stops of thine fright me the more.\nFor such things in a false, disloyal knave\nAre tricks of custom; but in a man that's just,\nThey're close dilations working from the heart\nThat passion cannot rule.\n\nIAGO  For Michael Cassio,\nI dare be sworn I think that he is honest.\n\nOTHELLO\nI think so too.\n\nIAGO  Men should be what they seem;\nOr those that be not, would they might seem none!\n\nOTHELLO  Certain, men should be what they seem.\n\nIAGO\nWhy then, I think Cassio's an honest man.\n\nOTHELLO  Nay, yet there's more in this.\nI prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,\nAs thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of\nthoughts\nThe worst of words.\n\nIAGO  Good my lord, pardon me.\nThough I am bound to every act of duty,\nI am not bound to that all slaves are free to.\nUtter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and\nfalse--\nAs where's that palace whereinto foul things\nSometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so\npure\nBut some uncleanly apprehensions\nKeep leets and law days and in sessions sit\nWith meditations lawful?\n\nOTHELLO\nThou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,\nIf thou but think'st him wronged and mak'st his ear\nA stranger to thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO  I do beseech you,\nThough I perchance am vicious in my guess--\nAs, I confess, it is my nature's plague\nTo spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy\nShapes faults that are not--that your wisdom\nFrom one that so imperfectly conceits\nWould take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble\nOut of his scattering and unsure observance.\nIt were not for your quiet nor your good,\nNor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,\nTo let you know my thoughts.\n\nOTHELLO  What dost thou mean?\n\nIAGO\nGood name in man and woman, dear my lord,\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls.\nWho steals my purse steals trash. 'Tis something,\nnothing;\n'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to\nthousands.\nBut he that filches from me my good name\nRobs me of that which not enriches him\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\n\nOTHELLO  By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.\n\nIAGO\nYou cannot, if my heart were in your hand,\nNor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.\n\nOTHELLO\nHa?\n\nIAGO  O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!\nIt is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\nThe meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss\nWho, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;\nBut O, what damned minutes tells he o'er\nWho dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!\n\nOTHELLO  O misery!\n\nIAGO\nPoor and content is rich, and rich enough;\nBut riches fineless is as poor as winter\nTo him that ever fears he shall be poor.\nGood God, the souls of all my tribe defend\nFrom jealousy!\n\nOTHELLO  Why, why is this?\nThink'st thou I'd make a life of jealousy,\nTo follow still the changes of the moon\nWith fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt\nIs once to be resolved. Exchange me for a goat\nWhen I shall turn the business of my soul\nTo such exsufflicate and blown surmises,\nMatching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous\nTo say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,\nIs free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well.\nWhere virtue is, these are more virtuous.\nNor from mine own weak merits will I draw\nThe smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,\nFor she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,\nI'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;\nAnd on the proof, there is no more but this:\nAway at once with love or jealousy.\n\nIAGO\nI am glad of this, for now I shall have reason\nTo show the love and duty that I bear you\nWith franker spirit. Therefore, as I am bound,\nReceive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.\nLook to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;\nWear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.\nI would not have your free and noble nature,\nOut of self-bounty, be abused. Look to 't.\nI know our country disposition well.\nIn Venice they do let God see the pranks\nThey dare not show their husbands. Their best\nconscience\nIs not to leave 't undone, but keep 't unknown.\n\nOTHELLO  Dost thou say so?\n\nIAGO\nShe did deceive her father, marrying you,\nAnd when she seemed to shake and fear your looks,\nShe loved them most.\n\nOTHELLO  And so she did.\n\nIAGO  Why, go to, then!\nShe that, so young, could give out such a seeming,\nTo seel her father's eyes up close as oak,\nHe thought 'twas witchcraft! But I am much to\nblame.\nI humbly do beseech you of your pardon\nFor too much loving you.\n\nOTHELLO  I am bound to thee forever.\n\nIAGO\nI see this hath a little dashed your spirits.\n\nOTHELLO\nNot a jot, not a jot.\n\nIAGO  I' faith, I fear it has.\nI hope you will consider what is spoke\nComes from my love. But I do see you're moved.\nI am to pray you not to strain my speech\nTo grosser issues nor to larger reach\nThan to suspicion.\n\nOTHELLO  I will not.\n\nIAGO  Should you do so, my lord,\nMy speech should fall into such vile success\nAs my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy\nfriend.\nMy lord, I see you're moved.\n\nOTHELLO  No, not much moved.\nI do not think but Desdemona's honest.\n\nIAGO\nLong live she so! And long live you to think so!\n\nOTHELLO\nAnd yet, how nature erring from itself--\n\nIAGO\nAy, there's the point. As, to be bold with you,\nNot to affect many proposed matches\nOf her own clime, complexion, and degree,\nWhereto we see in all things nature tends--\nFoh! One may smell in such a will most rank,\nFoul disproportion, thoughts unnatural--\nBut pardon me--I do not in position\nDistinctly speak of her, though I may fear\nHer will, recoiling to her better judgment,\nMay fall to match you with her country forms\nAnd happily repent.\n\nOTHELLO  Farewell, farewell!\nIf more thou dost perceive, let me know more.\nSet on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.\n\nIAGO, [beginning to exit]  My lord, I take my leave.\n\nOTHELLO\nWhy did I marry? This honest creature doubtless\nSees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.\n\nIAGO, [returning]\nMy lord, I would I might entreat your Honor\nTo scan this thing no farther. Leave it to time.\nAlthough 'tis fit that Cassio have his place--\nFor sure he fills it up with great ability--\nYet, if you please to hold him off awhile,\nYou shall by that perceive him and his means.\nNote if your lady strain his entertainment\nWith any strong or vehement importunity.\nMuch will be seen in that. In the meantime,\nLet me be thought too busy in my fears--\nAs worthy cause I have to fear I am--\nAnd hold her free, I do beseech your Honor.\n\nOTHELLO  Fear not my government.\n\nIAGO  I once more take my leave.\t[He exits.]\n\nOTHELLO\nThis fellow's of exceeding honesty,\nAnd knows all qualities with a learned spirit\nOf human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,\nThough that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,\nI'd whistle her off and let her down the wind\nTo prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black\nAnd have not those soft parts of conversation\nThat chamberers have, or for I am declined\nInto the vale of years--yet that's not much--\nShe's gone, I am abused, and my relief\nMust be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,\nThat we can call these delicate creatures ours\nAnd not their appetites! I had rather be a toad\nAnd live upon the vapor of a dungeon\nThan keep a corner in the thing I love\nFor others' uses. Yet 'tis the plague of great ones;\nPrerogatived are they less than the base.\n'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.\nEven then this forked plague is fated to us\nWhen we do quicken. Look where she comes.\n\n[Enter Desdemona and Emilia.]\n\nIf she be false, heaven mocks itself!\nI'll not believe 't.\n\nDESDEMONA  How now, my dear Othello?\nYour dinner, and the generous islanders\nBy you invited, do attend your presence.\n\nOTHELLO  I am to blame.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhy do you speak so faintly? Are you not well?\n\nOTHELLO\nI have a pain upon my forehead, here.\n\nDESDEMONA\nFaith, that's with watching. 'Twill away again.\nLet me but bind it hard; within this hour\nIt will be well.\n\nOTHELLO  Your napkin is too little.\nLet it alone.\t[The handkerchief falls, unnoticed.]\nCome, I'll go in with you.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI am very sorry that you are not well.\n[Othello and Desdemona exit.]\n\nEMILIA, [picking up the handkerchief]\nI am glad I have found this napkin.\nThis was her first remembrance from the Moor.\nMy wayward husband hath a hundred times\nWooed me to steal it. But she so loves the token\n(For he conjured her she should ever keep it)\nThat she reserves it evermore about her\nTo kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out\nAnd give 't Iago. What he will do with it\nHeaven knows, not I.\nI nothing but to please his fantasy.\n\n[Enter Iago.]\n\n\nIAGO  How now? What do you here alone?\n\nEMILIA\nDo not you chide. I have a thing for you.\n\nIAGO\nYou have a thing for me? It is a common thing--\n\nEMILIA  Ha?\n\nIAGO  To have a foolish wife.\n\nEMILIA\nO, is that all? What will you give me now\nFor that same handkerchief?\n\nIAGO  What handkerchief?\n\nEMILIA  What handkerchief?\nWhy, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,\nThat which so often you did bid me steal.\n\nIAGO  Hast stol'n it from her?\n\nEMILIA\nNo, faith, she let it drop by negligence,\nAnd to th' advantage I, being here, took 't up.\nLook, here 'tis.\n\nIAGO  A good wench! Give it me.\n\nEMILIA\nWhat will you do with 't, that you have been so\nearnest\nTo have me filch it?\n\nIAGO, [snatching it]  Why, what is that to you?\n\nEMILIA\nIf it be not for some purpose of import,\nGive 't me again. Poor lady, she'll run mad\nWhen she shall lack it.\n\nIAGO  Be not acknown on 't.\nI have use for it. Go, leave me.\t[Emilia exits.]\nI will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin\nAnd let him find it. Trifles light as air\nAre to the jealous confirmations strong\nAs proofs of holy writ. This may do something.\nThe Moor already changes with my poison;\nDangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,\nWhich at the first are scarce found to distaste,\nBut with a little act upon the blood\nBurn like the mines of sulfur.\n\n[Enter Othello.]\n\nI did say so.\nLook where he comes. Not poppy nor mandragora\nNor all the drowsy syrups of the world\nShall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\nWhich thou owedst yesterday.\n\nOTHELLO  Ha, ha, false to me?\n\nIAGO\nWhy, how now, general? No more of that!\n\nOTHELLO\nAvaunt! Begone! Thou hast set me on the rack.\nI swear 'tis better to be much abused\nThan but to know 't a little.\n\nIAGO  How now, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\nWhat sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?\nI saw 't not, thought it not; it harmed not me.\nI slept the next night well, fed well, was free and\nmerry.\nI found not Cassio's kisses on her lips.\nHe that is robbed, not wanting what is stol'n,\nLet him not know 't, and he's not robbed at all.\n\nIAGO  I am sorry to hear this.\n\nOTHELLO\nI had been happy if the general camp,\nPioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,\nSo I had nothing known. O, now, forever\nFarewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!\nFarewell the plumed troops and the big wars\nThat makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!\nFarewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,\nThe spirit-stirring drum, th' ear-piercing fife,\nThe royal banner, and all quality,\nPride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!\nAnd O you mortal engines, whose rude throats\nTh' immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit,\nFarewell! Othello's occupation's gone!\n\nIAGO  Is 't possible, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\nVillain, be sure thou prove my love a whore!\nBe sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,\nOr, by the worth of mine eternal soul,\nThou hadst been better have been born a dog\nThan answer my waked wrath.\n\nIAGO  Is 't come to this?\n\nOTHELLO\nMake me to see 't, or at the least so prove it\nThat the probation bear no hinge nor loop\nTo hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life!\n\nIAGO  My noble lord--\n\nOTHELLO\nIf thou dost slander her and torture me,\nNever pray more. Abandon all remorse;\nOn horror's head horrors accumulate;\nDo deeds to make heaven weep, all Earth amazed;\nFor nothing canst thou to damnation add\nGreater than that.\n\nIAGO  O grace! O heaven forgive me!\nAre you a man? Have you a soul or sense?\nGod b' wi' you. Take mine office.--O wretched fool,\nThat liv'st to make thine honesty a vice!--\nO monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world:\nTo be direct and honest is not safe.--\nI thank you for this profit, and from hence\nI'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.\n\nOTHELLO  Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.\n\nIAGO\nI should be wise; for honesty's a fool\nAnd loses that it works for.\n\nOTHELLO  By the world,\nI think my wife be honest and think she is not.\nI think that thou art just and think thou art not.\nI'll have some proof! Her name, that was as fresh\nAs Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black\nAs mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,\nPoison, or fire, or suffocating streams,\nI'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!\n\nIAGO\nI see you are eaten up with passion.\nI do repent me that I put it to you.\nYou would be satisfied?\n\nOTHELLO  Would? Nay, and I will.\n\nIAGO\nAnd may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?\nWould you, the supervisor, grossly gape on,\nBehold her topped?\n\nOTHELLO  Death and damnation! O!\n\nIAGO\nIt were a tedious difficulty, I think,\nTo bring them to that prospect. Damn them then\nIf ever mortal eyes do see them bolster\nMore than their own! What then? How then?\nWhat shall I say? Where's satisfaction?\nIt is impossible you should see this,\nWere they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,\nAs salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross\nAs ignorance made drunk. But yet I say,\nIf imputation and strong circumstances\nWhich lead directly to the door of truth\nWill give you satisfaction, you might have 't.\n\nOTHELLO\nGive me a living reason she's disloyal.\n\nIAGO  I do not like the office,\nBut sith I am entered in this cause so far,\nPricked to 't by foolish honesty and love,\nI will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,\nAnd being troubled with a raging tooth\nI could not sleep. There are a kind of men\nSo loose of soul that in their sleeps will mutter\nTheir affairs. One of this kind is Cassio.\nIn sleep I heard him say \"Sweet Desdemona,\nLet us be wary, let us hide our loves.\"\nAnd then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,\nCry \"O sweet creature!\" then kiss me hard,\nAs if he plucked up kisses by the roots\nThat grew upon my lips; then laid his leg\nO'er my thigh, and sighed, and kissed, and then\nCried \"Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!\"\n\nOTHELLO\nO monstrous! Monstrous!\n\nIAGO  Nay, this was but his\ndream.\n\nOTHELLO\nBut this denoted a foregone conclusion.\n'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.\n\nIAGO\nAnd this may help to thicken other proofs\nThat do demonstrate thinly.\n\nOTHELLO  I'll tear her all to pieces.\n\nIAGO\nNay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done.\nShe may be honest yet. Tell me but this:\nHave you not sometimes seen a handkerchief\nSpotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?\n\nOTHELLO\nI gave her such a one. 'Twas my first gift.\n\nIAGO\nI know not that; but such a handkerchief--\nI am sure it was your wife's--did I today\nSee Cassio wipe his beard with.\n\nOTHELLO  If it be that--\n\nIAGO\nIf it be that, or any that was hers,\nIt speaks against her with the other proofs.\n\nOTHELLO\nO, that the slave had forty thousand lives!\nOne is too poor, too weak for my revenge.\nNow do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago,\nAll my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.\n'Tis gone.\nArise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!\nYield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne\nTo tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,\nFor 'tis of aspics' tongues!\n\nIAGO  Yet be content.\n\nOTHELLO  O, blood, blood, blood!\n\nIAGO\nPatience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.\n\nOTHELLO\nNever, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,\nWhose icy current and compulsive course\nNe'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on\nTo the Propontic and the Hellespont,\nEven so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace\nShall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,\nTill that a capable and wide revenge\nSwallow them up. [He kneels.] Now by yond marble\nheaven,\nIn the due reverence of a sacred vow,\nI here engage my words.\n\nIAGO  Do not rise yet.\t[Iago kneels.]\nWitness, you ever-burning lights above,\nYou elements that clip us round about,\nWitness that here Iago doth give up\nThe execution of his wit, hands, heart\nTo wronged Othello's service! Let him command,\nAnd to obey shall be in me remorse,\nWhat bloody business ever.\t[They rise.]\n\nOTHELLO  I greet thy love\nNot with vain thanks but with acceptance\nbounteous,\nAnd will upon the instant put thee to 't.\nWithin these three days let me hear thee say\nThat Cassio's not alive.\n\nIAGO  My friend is dead.\n'Tis done at your request. But let her live.\n\nOTHELLO  Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn\nher!\nCome, go with me apart. I will withdraw\nTo furnish me with some swift means of death\nFor the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.\n\nIAGO  I am your own forever.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.]\n\n\nDESDEMONA  Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant\nCassio lies?\n\nCLOWN  I dare not say he lies anywhere.\n\nDESDEMONA  Why, man?\n\nCLOWN  He's a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies,\n'tis stabbing.\n\nDESDEMONA  Go to! Where lodges he?\n\nCLOWN  To tell you where he lodges is to tell you\nwhere I lie.\n\nDESDEMONA  Can anything be made of this?\n\nCLOWN  I know not where he lodges; and for me to\ndevise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies\nthere, were to lie in mine own throat.\n\nDESDEMONA  Can you inquire him out, and be edified\nby report?\n\nCLOWN  I will catechize the world for him--that is,\nmake questions, and by them answer.\n\nDESDEMONA  Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I\nhave moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will\nbe well.\n\nCLOWN  To do this is within the compass of man's wit,\nand therefore I will attempt the doing it.\n[Clown exits.]\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhere should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?\n\nEMILIA  I know not, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA\nBelieve me, I had rather have lost my purse\nFull of crusadoes. And but my noble Moor\nIs true of mind and made of no such baseness\nAs jealous creatures are, it were enough\nTo put him to ill thinking.\n\nEMILIA  Is he not jealous?\n\nDESDEMONA\nWho, he? I think the sun where he was born\nDrew all such humors from him.\n\nEMILIA  Look where he\ncomes.\n\n[Enter Othello.]\n\n\nDESDEMONA\nI will not leave him now till Cassio\nBe called to him.--How is 't with you, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\nWell, my good lady. [Aside.] O, hardness to\ndissemble!--\nHow do you, Desdemona?\n\nDESDEMONA  Well, my good lord.\n\nOTHELLO\nGive me your hand. [He takes her hand.] This hand\nis moist, my lady.\n\nDESDEMONA\nIt yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow.\n\nOTHELLO\nThis argues fruitfulness and liberal heart.\nHot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires\nA sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,\nMuch castigation, exercise devout;\nFor here's a young and sweating devil here\nThat commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,\nA frank one.\n\nDESDEMONA  You may indeed say so,\nFor 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.\n\nOTHELLO\nA liberal hand! The hearts of old gave hands,\nBut our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.\n\nOTHELLO  What promise, chuck?\n\nDESDEMONA\nI have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.\n\nOTHELLO\nI have a salt and sorry rheum offends me.\nLend me thy handkerchief.\n\nDESDEMONA  Here, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO\nThat which I gave you.\n\nDESDEMONA  I have it not about me.\n\nOTHELLO  Not?\n\nDESDEMONA  No, faith, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO  That's a fault. That handkerchief\nDid an Egyptian to my mother give.\nShe was a charmer, and could almost read\nThe thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept\nit,\n'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father\nEntirely to her love. But if she lost it,\nOr made a gift of it, my father's eye\nShould hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt\nAfter new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,\nAnd bid me, when my fate would have me wived,\nTo give it her. I did so; and take heed on 't,\nMake it a darling like your precious eye.\nTo lose 't or give 't away were such perdition\nAs nothing else could match.\n\nDESDEMONA  Is 't possible?\n\nOTHELLO\n'Tis true. There's magic in the web of it.\nA sybil that had numbered in the world\nThe sun to course two hundred compasses,\nIn her prophetic fury sewed the work.\nThe worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,\nAnd it was dyed in mummy, which the skillful\nConserved of maidens' hearts.\n\nDESDEMONA  I' faith, is 't true?\n\nOTHELLO\nMost veritable. Therefore, look to 't well.\n\nDESDEMONA\nThen would to God that I had never seen 't!\n\nOTHELLO  Ha? Wherefore?\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhy do you speak so startingly and rash?\n\nOTHELLO\nIs 't lost? Is 't gone? Speak, is 't out o' th' way?\n\nDESDEMONA  Heaven bless us!\n\nOTHELLO  Say you?\n\nDESDEMONA\nIt is not lost, but what an if it were?\n\nOTHELLO  How?\n\nDESDEMONA  I say it is not lost.\n\nOTHELLO  Fetch 't. Let me see 't!\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhy, so I can. But I will not now.\nThis is a trick to put me from my suit.\nPray you, let Cassio be received again.\n\nOTHELLO\nFetch me the handkerchief! [Aside.] My mind\nmisgives.\n\nDESDEMONA  Come, come.\nYou'll never meet a more sufficient man.\n\nOTHELLO\nThe handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA  I pray, talk me of Cassio.\n\nOTHELLOThe handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA  A man that all his time\nHath founded his good fortunes on your love;\nShared dangers with you--\n\nOTHELLO\nThe handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA  I' faith, you are to blame.\n\nOTHELLO  Zounds!\t[Othello exits.]\n\nEMILIA  Is not this man jealous?\n\nDESDEMONA  I ne'er saw this before.\nSure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief!\nI am most unhappy in the loss of it.\n\nEMILIA\n'Tis not a year or two shows us a man.\nThey are all but stomachs, and we all but food;\nThey eat us hungerly, and when they are full\nThey belch us.\n\n[Enter Iago and Cassio.]\n\nLook you--Cassio and my husband.\n\nIAGO, [to Cassio]\nThere is no other way; 'tis she must do 't,\nAnd, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.\n\nDESDEMONA\nHow now, good Cassio, what's the news with you?\n\nCASSIO\nMadam, my former suit. I do beseech you\nThat by your virtuous means I may again\nExist, and be a member of his love\nWhom I with all the office of my heart\nEntirely honor. I would not be delayed.\nIf my offense be of such mortal kind\nThat nor my service past nor present sorrows\nNor purposed merit in futurity\nCan ransom me into his love again,\nBut to know so must be my benefit.\nSo shall I clothe me in a forced content,\nAnd shut myself up in some other course\nTo fortune's alms.\n\nDESDEMONA  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,\nMy advocation is not now in tune.\nMy lord is not my lord; nor should I know him\nWere he in favor as in humor altered.\nSo help me every spirit sanctified\nAs I have spoken for you all my best,\nAnd stood within the blank of his displeasure\nFor my free speech! You must awhile be patient.\nWhat I can do I will; and more I will\nThan for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.\n\nIAGO\nIs my lord angry?\n\nEMILIA  He went hence but now,\nAnd certainly in strange unquietness.\n\nIAGO\nCan he be angry? I have seen the cannon\nWhen it hath blown his ranks into the air\nAnd, like the devil, from his very arm\nPuffed his own brother--and is he angry?\nSomething of moment then. I will go meet him.\nThere's matter in 't indeed if he be angry.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI prithee do so.\t[He exits.]\nSomething, sure, of state,\nEither from Venice, or some unhatched practice\nMade demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,\nHath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases\nMen's natures wrangle with inferior things,\nThough great ones are their object. 'Tis even so.\nFor let our finger ache, and it endues\nOur other healthful members even to a sense\nOf pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,\nNor of them look for such observancy\nAs fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,\nI was--unhandsome warrior as I am!--\nArraigning his unkindness with my soul.\nBut now I find I had suborned the witness,\nAnd he's indicted falsely.\n\nEMILIA  Pray heaven it be\nState matters, as you think, and no conception\nNor no jealous toy concerning you.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAlas the day, I never gave him cause!\n\nEMILIA\nBut jealous souls will not be answered so.\nThey are not ever jealous for the cause,\nBut jealous for they're jealous. It is a monster\nBegot upon itself, born on itself.\n\nDESDEMONA\nHeaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!\n\nEMILIA  Lady, amen.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI will go seek him.--Cassio, walk hereabout.\nIf I do find him fit, I'll move your suit\nAnd seek to effect it to my uttermost.\n\nCASSIO  I humbly thank your Ladyship.\n[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\n\n[Enter Bianca.]\n\n\nBIANCA\n'Save you, friend Cassio!\n\nCASSIO  What make you from\nhome?\nHow is 't with you, my most fair Bianca?\nI' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.\n\nBIANCA\nAnd I was going to your lodging, Cassio.\nWhat, keep a week away? Seven days and nights,\nEightscore eight hours, and lovers' absent hours\nMore tedious than the dial eightscore times?\nO weary reck'ning!\n\nCASSIO  Pardon me, Bianca.\nI have this while with leaden thoughts been pressed,\nBut I shall in a more continuate time\nStrike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,\n[Giving her Desdemona's handkerchief.]\nTake me this work out.\n\nBIANCA  O, Cassio, whence came this?\nThis is some token from a newer friend.\nTo the felt absence now I feel a cause.\nIs 't come to this? Well, well.\n\nCASSIO  Go to, woman!\nThrow your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,\nFrom whence you have them. You are jealous now\nThat this is from some mistress, some\nremembrance.\nNo, by my faith, Bianca.\n\nBIANCA  Why, whose is it?\n\nCASSIO\nI know not neither. I found it in my chamber.\nI like the work well. Ere it be demanded,\nAs like enough it will, I would have it copied.\nTake it, and do 't, and leave me for this time.\n\nBIANCA  Leave you? Wherefore?\n\nCASSIO\nI do attend here on the General,\nAnd think it no addition, nor my wish,\nTo have him see me womaned.\n\nBIANCA  Why, I pray you?\n\nCASSIO  Not that I love you not.\n\nBIANCA  But that you do not love me!\nI pray you bring me on the way a little,\nAnd say if I shall see you soon at night.\n\nCASSIO\n'Tis but a little way that I can bring you,\nFor I attend here. But I'll see you soon.\n\nBIANCA\n'Tis very good. I must be circumstanced.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 4\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Othello and Iago.]\n\n\nIAGO\nWill you think so?\n\nOTHELLO  Think so, Iago?\n\nIAGO  What,\nTo kiss in private?\n\nOTHELLO  An unauthorized kiss!\n\nIAGO\nOr to be naked with her friend in bed\nAn hour or more, not meaning any harm?\n\nOTHELLO\nNaked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm?\nIt is hypocrisy against the devil!\nThey that mean virtuously, and yet do so,\nThe devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt\nheaven.\n\nIAGO\nIf they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip.\nBut if I give my wife a handkerchief--\n\nOTHELLO  What then?\n\nIAGO\nWhy then, 'tis hers, my lord, and being hers,\nShe may, I think, bestow 't on any man.\n\nOTHELLO\nShe is protectress of her honor, too.\nMay she give that?\n\nIAGO\nHer honor is an essence that's not seen;\nThey have it very oft that have it not.\nBut for the handkerchief--\n\nOTHELLO\nBy heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.\nThou saidst--O, it comes o'er my memory\nAs doth the raven o'er the infectious house,\nBoding to all--he had my handkerchief.\n\nIAGO\nAy, what of that?\n\nOTHELLO  That's not so good now.\n\nIAGO  What\nIf I had said I had seen him do you wrong?\nOr heard him say (as knaves be such abroad,\nWho having, by their own importunate suit\nOr voluntary dotage of some mistress,\nConvinced or supplied them, cannot choose\nBut they must blab)--\n\nOTHELLO  Hath he said anything?\n\nIAGO\nHe hath, my lord, but be you well assured,\nNo more than he'll unswear.\n\nOTHELLO  What hath he said?\n\nIAGO\nFaith, that he did--I know not what he did.\n\nOTHELLO  What? What?\n\nIAGO\nLie--\n\nOTHELLO  With her?\n\nIAGO  With her--on her--what you will.\n\nOTHELLO  Lie with her? Lie on her? We say \"lie on her\"\nwhen they belie her. Lie with her--Zounds, that's\nfulsome! Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief.\nTo confess and be hanged for his labor.\nFirst to be hanged and then to confess--I tremble\nat it. Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing\npassion without some instruction. It is not\nwords that shakes me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and\nlips--is 't possible? Confess--handkerchief--O,\ndevil!\t[He falls in a trance.]\n\nIAGO  Work on,\nMy medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are\ncaught,\nAnd many worthy and chaste dames even thus,\nAll guiltless, meet reproach.--What ho! My lord!\nMy lord, I say. Othello!\n\n[Enter Cassio.]\n\nHow now, Cassio?\n\nCASSIO  What's the matter?\n\nIAGO\nMy lord is fall'n into an epilepsy.\nThis is his second fit. He had one yesterday.\n\nCASSIO\nRub him about the temples.\n\nIAGO  No, forbear.\nThe lethargy must have his quiet course.\nIf not, he foams at mouth, and by and by\nBreaks out to savage madness. Look, he stirs.\nDo you withdraw yourself a little while.\nHe will recover straight. When he is gone,\nI would on great occasion speak with you.\n[Cassio exits.]\nHow is it, general? Have you not hurt your head?\n\nOTHELLO\nDost thou mock me?\n\nIAGO  I mock you not, by heaven!\nWould you would bear your fortune like a man!\n\nOTHELLO\nA horned man's a monster and a beast.\n\nIAGO\nThere's many a beast, then, in a populous city,\nAnd many a civil monster.\n\nOTHELLO\nDid he confess it?\n\nIAGO  Good sir, be a man!\nThink every bearded fellow that's but yoked\nMay draw with you. There's millions now alive\nThat nightly lie in those unproper beds\nWhich they dare swear peculiar. Your case is better.\nO, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,\nTo lip a wanton in a secure couch\nAnd to suppose her chaste! No, let me know,\nAnd knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.\n\nOTHELLO  O, thou art wise, 'tis certain.\n\nIAGO  Stand you awhile apart.\nConfine yourself but in a patient list.\nWhilst you were here, o'erwhelmed with your grief--\nA passion most unsuiting such a man--\nCassio came hither. I shifted him away\nAnd laid good 'scuses upon your ecstasy,\nBade him anon return and here speak with me,\nThe which he promised. Do but encave yourself,\nAnd mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns\nThat dwell in every region of his face.\nFor I will make him tell the tale anew--\nWhere, how, how oft, how long ago, and when\nHe hath and is again to cope your wife.\nI say but mark his gesture. Marry, patience,\nOr I shall say you're all in all in spleen,\nAnd nothing of a man.\n\nOTHELLO  Dost thou hear, Iago,\nI will be found most cunning in my patience,\nBut (dost thou hear?) most bloody.\n\nIAGO  That's not amiss.\nBut yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?\n[Othello withdraws.]\nNow will I question Cassio of Bianca,\nA huswife that by selling her desires\nBuys herself bread and clothes. It is a creature\nThat dotes on Cassio--as 'tis the strumpet's plague\nTo beguile many and be beguiled by one.\nHe, when he hears of her, cannot restrain\nFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes.\n\n[Enter Cassio.]\n\nAs he shall smile, Othello shall go mad,\nAnd his unbookish jealousy must construe\nPoor Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behaviors\nQuite in the wrong.--How do you, lieutenant?\n\nCASSIO\nThe worser that you give me the addition\nWhose want even kills me.\n\nIAGO\nPly Desdemona well, and you are sure on 't.\nNow, if this suit lay in Bianca's power,\nHow quickly should you speed!\n\nCASSIO, [laughing]  Alas, poor caitiff!\n\nOTHELLO  Look how he laughs already!\n\nIAGO  I never knew woman love man so.\n\nCASSIO\nAlas, poor rogue, I think i' faith she loves me.\n\nOTHELLO\nNow he denies it faintly and laughs it out.\n\nIAGO\nDo you hear, Cassio?\n\nOTHELLO  Now he importunes him\nTo tell it o'er. Go to, well said, well said.\n\nIAGO\nShe gives it out that you shall marry her.\nDo you intend it?\n\nCASSIO  Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO\nDo you triumph, Roman? Do you triumph?\n\nCASSIO  I marry her? What, a customer? Prithee bear\nsome charity to my wit! Do not think it so unwholesome.\nHa, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO  So, so, so, so. They laugh that wins.\n\nIAGO\nFaith, the cry goes that you marry her.\n\nCASSIO  Prithee say true!\n\nIAGO  I am a very villain else.\n\nOTHELLO  Have you scored me? Well.\n\nCASSIO  This is the monkey's own giving out. She is\npersuaded I will marry her out of her own love and\nflattery, not out of my promise.\n\nOTHELLO\nIago beckons me. Now he begins the story.\n\nCASSIO  She was here even now. She haunts me in\nevery place. I was the other day talking on the\nsea-bank with certain Venetians, and thither comes\nthe bauble. By this hand, she falls thus about my\nneck!\n\nOTHELLO  Crying, \"O dear Cassio,\" as it were; his\ngesture imports it.\n\nCASSIO  So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me, so\nshakes and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha!\n\nOTHELLO  Now he tells how she plucked him to my\nchamber.--O, I see that nose of yours, but not that\ndog I shall throw it to.\n\nCASSIO  Well, I must leave her company.\n\nIAGO  Before me, look where she comes.\n\n[Enter Bianca.]\n\n\nCASSIO  'Tis such another fitchew--marry, a perfumed\none!--What do you mean by this haunting\nof me?\n\nBIANCA  Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did\nyou mean by that same handkerchief you gave me\neven now? I was a fine fool to take it! I must take\nout the work? A likely piece of work, that you\nshould find it in your chamber and know not who\nleft it there! This is some minx's token, and I must\ntake out the work! There, give it your hobbyhorse.\nWheresoever you had it, I'll take out no work on 't.\n\nCASSIO\nHow now, my sweet Bianca? How now? How now?\n\nOTHELLO\nBy heaven, that should be my handkerchief!\n\nBIANCA  If you'll come to supper tonight you may. If\nyou will not, come when you are next prepared\nfor.\t[She exits.]\n\nIAGO  After her, after her!\n\nCASSIO  Faith, I must. She'll rail in the streets else.\n\nIAGO  Will you sup there?\n\nCASSIO  Faith, I intend so.\n\nIAGO  Well, I may chance to see you, for I would very\nfain speak with you.\n\nCASSIO  Prithee come. Will you?\n\nIAGO  Go to; say no more.\t[Cassio exits.]\n\nOTHELLO, [coming forward]  How shall I murder him,\nIago?\n\nIAGO  Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?\n\nOTHELLO  O Iago!\n\nIAGO  And did you see the handkerchief?\n\nOTHELLO  Was that mine?\n\nIAGO  Yours, by this hand! And to see how he prizes\nthe foolish woman your wife! She gave it him, and\nhe hath giv'n it his whore.\n\nOTHELLO  I would have him nine years a-killing! A fine\nwoman, a fair woman, a sweet woman!\n\nIAGO  Nay, you must forget that.\n\nOTHELLO  Ay, let her rot and perish and be damned\ntonight, for she shall not live. No, my heart is turned\nto stone. I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the\nworld hath not a sweeter creature! She might lie by\nan emperor's side and command him tasks.\n\nIAGO  Nay, that's not your way.\n\nOTHELLO  Hang her, I do but say what she is! So\ndelicate with her needle, an admirable musician--\nO, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!\nOf so high and plenteous wit and invention!\n\nIAGO  She's the worse for all this.\n\nOTHELLO  O, a thousand, a thousand times!--And then\nof so gentle a condition!\n\nIAGO  Ay, too gentle.\n\nOTHELLO  Nay, that's certain. But yet the pity of it,\nIago! O, Iago, the pity of it, Iago!\n\nIAGO  If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her\npatent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes\nnear nobody.\n\nOTHELLO  I will chop her into messes! Cuckold me?\n\nIAGO  O, 'tis foul in her.\n\nOTHELLO  With mine officer!\n\nIAGO  That's fouler.\n\nOTHELLO  Get me some poison, Iago, this night. I'll not\nexpostulate with her lest her body and beauty\nunprovide my mind again. This night, Iago.\n\nIAGO  Do it not with poison. Strangle her in her bed,\neven the bed she hath contaminated.\n\nOTHELLO  Good, good. The justice of it pleases. Very\ngood.\n\nIAGO  And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker. You\nshall hear more by midnight.\n\nOTHELLO\nExcellent good.\t[A trumpet sounds.]\nWhat trumpet is that same?\n\nIAGO  I warrant something from Venice.\n\n[Enter Lodovico, Desdemona, and Attendants.]\n\n'Tis Lodovico. This comes from the Duke.\nSee, your wife's with him.\n\nLODOVICO  God save you, worthy general.\n\nOTHELLO  With all my heart, sir.\n\nLODOVICO\nThe Duke and the Senators of Venice greet you.\n[He hands Othello a paper.]\n\nOTHELLO\nI kiss the instrument of their pleasures.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAnd what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?\n\nIAGO\nI am very glad to see you, signior.\nWelcome to Cyprus.\n\nLODOVICO\nI thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?\n\nIAGO  Lives, sir.\n\nDESDEMONA\nCousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord\nAn unkind breach, but you shall make all well.\n\nOTHELLO  Are you sure of that?\n\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\n\nOTHELLO, [reading]  \"This fail you not to do, as you\nwill\"--\n\nLODOVICO\nHe did not call; he's busy in the paper.\nIs there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?\n\nDESDEMONA\nA most unhappy one. I would do much\nT' atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.\n\nOTHELLO  Fire and brimstone!\n\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\n\nOTHELLO  Are you wise?\n\nDESDEMONA\nWhat, is he angry?\n\nLODOVICO  May be the letter moved him.\nFor, as I think, they do command him home,\nDeputing Cassio in his government.\n\nDESDEMONA  By my troth, I am glad on 't.\n\nOTHELLO  Indeed?\n\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\n\nOTHELLO  I am glad to see you mad.\n\nDESDEMONA  Why, sweet Othello!\n\nOTHELLO, [striking her]  Devil!\n\nDESDEMONA  I have not deserved this.\n\nLODOVICO\nMy lord, this would not be believed in Venice,\nThough I should swear I saw 't. 'Tis very much.\nMake her amends. She weeps.\n\nOTHELLO  O, devil, devil!\nIf that the Earth could teem with woman's tears,\nEach drop she falls would prove a crocodile.\nOut of my sight!\n\nDESDEMONA  I will not stay to offend you.\n[She begins to leave.]\n\nLODOVICO  Truly an obedient lady.\nI do beseech your Lordship call her back.\n\nOTHELLO  Mistress.\n\nDESDEMONA, [turning back]  My lord?\n\nOTHELLO  What would you with her, sir?\n\nLODOVICO  Who, I, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\nAy, you did wish that I would make her turn.\nSir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,\nAnd turn again. And she can weep, sir, weep.\nAnd she's obedient, as you say, obedient.\nVery obedient.--Proceed you in your tears.--\nConcerning this, sir--O, well-painted passion!--\nI am commanded home.--Get you away.\nI'll send for you anon.--Sir, I obey the mandate\nAnd will return to Venice.--Hence, avaunt!\n[Desdemona exits.]\nCassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight\nI do entreat that we may sup together.\nYou are welcome, sir, to Cyprus. Goats and\nmonkeys!\t[He exits.]\n\nLODOVICO\nIs this the noble Moor, whom our full senate\nCall all in all sufficient? Is this the nature\nWhom passion could not shake, whose solid virtue\nThe shot of accident nor dart of chance\nCould neither graze nor pierce?\n\nIAGO  He is much\nchanged.\n\nLODOVICO\nAre his wits safe? Is he not light of brain?\n\nIAGO\nHe's that he is. I may not breathe my censure\nWhat he might be. If what he might he is not,\nI would to heaven he were.\n\nLODOVICO  What? Strike his wife?\n\nIAGO\n'Faith, that was not so well. Yet would I knew\nThat stroke would prove the worst.\n\nLODOVICO  Is it his use?\nOr did the letters work upon his blood\nAnd new-create this fault?\n\nIAGO  Alas, alas!\nIt is not honesty in me to speak\nWhat I have seen and known. You shall observe\nhim,\nAnd his own courses will denote him so\nThat I may save my speech. Do but go after\nAnd mark how he continues.\n\nLODOVICO\nI am sorry that I am deceived in him.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Othello and Emilia.]\n\n\nOTHELLO  You have seen nothing then?\n\nEMILIA\nNor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.\n\nOTHELLO\nYes, you have seen Cassio and she together.\n\nEMILIA\nBut then I saw no harm, and then I heard\nEach syllable that breath made up between them.\n\nOTHELLO\nWhat, did they never whisper?\n\nEMILIA  Never, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO  Nor send you out o' th' way?\n\nEMILIA  Never.\n\nOTHELLO\nTo fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?\n\nEMILIA  Never, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO  That's strange.\n\nEMILIA\nI durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,\nLay down my soul at stake. If you think other,\nRemove your thought. It doth abuse your bosom.\nIf any wretch have put this in your head,\nLet heaven requite it with the serpent's curse,\nFor if she be not honest, chaste, and true,\nThere's no man happy. The purest of their wives\nIs foul as slander.\n\nOTHELLO  Bid her come hither. Go.\n[Emilia exits.]\nShe says enough. Yet she's a simple bawd\nThat cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,\nA closet lock and key of villainous secrets.\nAnd yet she'll kneel and pray. I have seen her do 't.\n\n[Enter Desdemona and Emilia.]\n\n\nDESDEMONA  My lord, what is your will?\n\nOTHELLO\nPray you, chuck, come hither.\n\nDESDEMONA  What is your\npleasure?\n\nOTHELLO\nLet me see your eyes. Look in my face.\n\nDESDEMONA  What horrible fancy's this?\n\nOTHELLO, [to Emilia]  Some of your function,\nmistress.\nLeave procreants alone, and shut the door.\nCough, or cry \"hem,\" if anybody come.\nYour mystery, your mystery! Nay, dispatch.\n[Emilia exits.]\n\nDESDEMONA, [kneeling]\nUpon my knees, what doth your speech import?\nI understand a fury in your words,\nBut not the words.\n\nOTHELLO  Why? What art thou?\n\nDESDEMONA\nYour wife, my lord, your true and loyal wife.\n\nOTHELLO  Come, swear it. Damn thyself,\nLest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves\nShould fear to seize thee. Therefore be double\ndamned.\nSwear thou art honest.\n\nDESDEMONA  Heaven doth truly know it.\n\nOTHELLO\nHeaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.\n\nDESDEMONA, [standing]\nTo whom, my lord? With whom? How am I false?\n\nOTHELLO\nAh, Desdemon, away, away, away!\n\nDESDEMONA\nAlas the heavy day, why do you weep?\nAm I the motive of these tears, my lord?\nIf haply you my father do suspect\nAn instrument of this your calling back,\nLay not your blame on me. If you have lost him,\nI have lost him too.\n\nOTHELLO  Had it pleased heaven\nTo try me with affliction, had they rained\nAll kind of sores and shames on my bare head,\nSteeped me in poverty to the very lips,\nGiven to captivity me and my utmost hopes,\nI should have found in some place of my soul\nA drop of patience. But alas, to make me\nA fixed figure for the time of scorn\nTo point his slow unmoving finger at--\nYet could I bear that too, well, very well.\nBut there where I have garnered up my heart,\nWhere either I must live or bear no life,\nThe fountain from the which my current runs\nOr else dries up--to be discarded thence,\nOr keep it as a cistern for foul toads\nTo knot and gender in--turn thy complexion there,\nPatience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubin,\nAy, there look grim as hell.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI hope my noble lord esteems me honest.\n\nOTHELLO\nO, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles,\nThat quicken even with blowing! O thou weed,\nWho art so lovely fair, and smell'st so sweet\nThat the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst\nne'er been born!\n\nDESDEMONA\nAlas, what ignorant sin have I committed?\n\nOTHELLO\nWas this fair paper, this most goodly book,\nMade to write \"whore\" upon? What committed?\nCommitted? O thou public commoner,\nI should make very forges of my cheeks\nThat would to cinders burn up modesty,\nDid I but speak thy deeds. What committed?\nHeaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks;\nThe bawdy wind that kisses all it meets\nIs hushed within the hollow mine of earth\nAnd will not hear 't. What committed?\nImpudent strumpet!\n\nDESDEMONA  By heaven, you do me wrong!\n\nOTHELLO  Are not you a strumpet?\n\nDESDEMONA  No, as I am a Christian!\nIf to preserve this vessel for my lord\nFrom any other foul unlawful touch\nBe not to be a strumpet, I am none.\n\nOTHELLO  What, not a whore?\n\nDESDEMONA  No, as I shall be saved.\n\nOTHELLO  Is 't possible?\n\nDESDEMONA\nO, heaven forgive us!\n\nOTHELLO  I cry you mercy, then.\nI took you for that cunning whore of Venice\nThat married with Othello.--You, mistress,\n\n[Enter Emilia.]\n\nThat have the office opposite to Saint Peter\nAnd keeps the gate of hell--you, you, ay, you!\nWe have done our course. There's money for your\npains.\t[He gives her money.]\nI pray you turn the key and keep our counsel.\n[He exits.]\n\nEMILIA\nAlas, what does this gentleman conceive?\nHow do you, madam? How do you, my good lady?\n\nDESDEMONA  Faith, half asleep.\n\nEMILIA\nGood madam, what's the matter with my lord?\n\nDESDEMONA  With who?\n\nEMILIA  Why, with my lord, madam.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWho is thy lord?\n\nEMILIA  He that is yours, sweet lady.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI have none. Do not talk to me, Emilia.\nI cannot weep, nor answers have I none\nBut what should go by water. Prithee, tonight\nLay on my bed my wedding sheets. Remember.\nAnd call thy husband hither.\n\nEMILIA  Here's a change indeed.\t[She exits.]\n\nDESDEMONA\n'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.\nHow have I been behaved that he might stick\nThe small'st opinion on my least misuse?\n\n[Enter Iago and Emilia.]\n\n\nIAGO\nWhat is your pleasure, madam? How is 't with you?\n\nDESDEMONA\nI cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes\nDo it with gentle means and easy tasks.\nHe might have chid me so, for, in good faith,\nI am a child to chiding.\n\nIAGO  What is the matter, lady?\n\nEMILIA\nAlas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her,\nThrown such despite and heavy terms upon her\nAs true hearts cannot bear.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAm I that name, Iago?\n\nIAGO  What name, fair\nlady?\n\nDESDEMONA\nSuch as she said my lord did say I was.\n\nEMILIA\nHe called her \"whore.\" A beggar in his drink\nCould not have laid such terms upon his callet.\n\nIAGO  Why did he so?\n\nDESDEMONA\nI do not know. I am sure I am none such.\n\nIAGO\nDo not weep, do not weep! Alas the day!\n\nEMILIA\nHath she forsook so many noble matches,\nHer father and her country and her friends,\nTo be called \"whore\"? Would it not make one\nweep?\n\nDESDEMONA  It is my wretched fortune.\n\nIAGO\nBeshrew him for 't! How comes this trick upon him?\n\nDESDEMONA  Nay, heaven doth know.\n\nEMILIA\nI will be hanged if some eternal villain,\nSome busy and insinuating rogue,\nSome cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,\nHave not devised this slander. I will be hanged else.\n\nIAGO\nFie, there is no such man. It is impossible.\n\nDESDEMONA\nIf any such there be, heaven pardon him.\n\nEMILIA\nA halter pardon him, and hell gnaw his bones!\nWhy should he call her \"whore\"? Who keeps her\ncompany?\nWhat place? What time? What form? What\nlikelihood?\nThe Moor's abused by some most villainous knave,\nSome base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.\nO heaven, that such companions thou 'dst unfold,\nAnd put in every honest hand a whip\nTo lash the rascals naked through the world,\nEven from the east to th' west!\n\nIAGO  Speak within door.\n\nEMILIA\nO, fie upon them! Some such squire he was\nThat turned your wit the seamy side without\nAnd made you to suspect me with the Moor.\n\nIAGO\nYou are a fool. Go to!\n\nDESDEMONA  Alas, Iago,\nWhat shall I do to win my lord again?\nGood friend, go to him. For by this light of heaven,\nI know not how I lost him. [She kneels.] Here I\nkneel.\nIf e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,\nEither in discourse of thought or actual deed,\nOr that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense\nDelighted them in any other form,\nOr that I do not yet, and ever did,\nAnd ever will--though he do shake me off\nTo beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,\nComfort forswear me! [She stands.] Unkindness may\ndo much,\nAnd his unkindness may defeat my life,\nBut never taint my love. I cannot say \"whore\"--\nIt does abhor me now I speak the word.\nTo do the act that might the addition earn,\nNot the world's mass of vanity could make me.\n\nIAGO\nI pray you be content. 'Tis but his humor.\nThe business of the state does him offense,\nAnd he does chide with you.\n\nDESDEMONA\nIf 'twere no other--\n\nIAGO  It is but so, I warrant.\n[Trumpets sound.]\nHark how these instruments summon to supper.\nThe messengers of Venice stays the meat.\nGo in and weep not. All things shall be well.\n[Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\n\n[Enter Roderigo.]\n\nHow now, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO  I do not find\nThat thou deal'st justly with me.\n\nIAGO  What in the contrary?\n\nRODERIGO  Every day thou daff'st me with some device,\nIago, and rather, as it seems to me now,\nkeep'st from me all conveniency than suppliest me\nwith the least advantage of hope. I will indeed no\nlonger endure it. Nor am I yet persuaded to put up\nin peace what already I have foolishly suffered.\n\nIAGO  Will you hear me, Roderigo?\n\nRODERIGO  Faith, I have heard too much, and your\nwords and performances are no kin together.\n\nIAGO  You charge me most unjustly.\n\nRODERIGO  With naught but truth. I have wasted myself\nout of my means. The jewels you have had\nfrom me to deliver to Desdemona would half have\ncorrupted a votaress. You have told me she hath\nreceived them, and returned me expectations and\ncomforts of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I\nfind none.\n\nIAGO  Well, go to! Very well.\n\nRODERIGO  \"Very well.\" \"Go to!\" I cannot go to, man,\nnor 'tis not very well! By this hand, I say 'tis very\nscurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.\n\nIAGO  Very well.\n\nRODERIGO  I tell you 'tis not very well! I will make\nmyself known to Desdemona. If she will return me\nmy jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my\nunlawful solicitation. If not, assure yourself I will\nseek satisfaction of you.\n\nIAGO  You have said now.\n\nRODERIGO  Ay, and said nothing but what I protest\nintendment of doing.\n\nIAGO  Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even\nfrom this instant do build on thee a better opinion\nthan ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo.\nThou hast taken against me a most just exception,\nbut yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy\naffair.\n\nRODERIGO  It hath not appeared.\n\nIAGO  I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your\nsuspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,\nRoderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed which I\nhave greater reason to believe now than ever--I\nmean purpose, courage, and valor--this night show\nit. If thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,\ntake me from this world with treachery and\ndevise engines for my life.\n\nRODERIGO  Well, what is it? Is it within reason and\ncompass?\n\nIAGO  Sir, there is especial commission come from\nVenice to depute Cassio in Othello's place.\n\nRODERIGO  Is that true? Why, then, Othello and Desdemona\nreturn again to Venice.\n\nIAGO  O, no. He goes into Mauritania and takes away\nwith him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be\nlingered here by some accident--wherein none\ncan be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.\n\nRODERIGO  How do you mean, removing him?\n\nIAGO  Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's\nplace: knocking out his brains.\n\nRODERIGO  And that you would have me to do?\n\nIAGO  Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He\nsups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to\nhim. He knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If\nyou will watch his going thence (which I will\nfashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may\ntake him at your pleasure. I will be near to second\nyour attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come,\nstand not amazed at it, but go along with me. I will\nshow you such a necessity in his death that you shall\nthink yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high\nsupper time, and the night grows to waste. About it!\n\nRODERIGO  I will hear further reason for this.\n\nIAGO  And you shall be satisfied.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and\nAttendants.]\n\n\nLODOVICO\nI do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.\n\nOTHELLO\nO, pardon me, 'twill do me good to walk.\n\nLODOVICO\nMadam, good night. I humbly thank your Ladyship.\n\nDESDEMONA  Your Honor is most welcome.\n\nOTHELLO\nWill you walk, sir?--O, Desdemona--\n\nDESDEMONA  My lord?\n\nOTHELLO  Get you to bed on th' instant. I will be\nreturned forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there.\nLook 't be done.\n\nDESDEMONA  I will, my lord.\n[All but Desdemona and Emilia exit.]\n\nEMILIA\nHow goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.\n\nDESDEMONA\nHe says he will return incontinent,\nAnd hath commanded me to go to bed,\nAnd bade me to dismiss you.\n\nEMILIA  Dismiss me?\n\nDESDEMONA\nIt was his bidding. Therefore, good Emilia,\nGive me my nightly wearing, and adieu.\nWe must not now displease him.\n\nEMILIA  I would you had never seen him.\n\nDESDEMONA\nSo would not I. My love doth so approve him\nThat even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns--\nPrithee, unpin me--have grace and favor in them.\n\nEMILIA\nI have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAll's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!\nIf I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me\nIn one of those same sheets.\n\nEMILIA  Come, come, you talk!\n\nDESDEMONA\nMy mother had a maid called Barbary.\nShe was in love, and he she loved proved mad\nAnd did forsake her. She had a song of willow,\nAn old thing 'twas, but it expressed her fortune,\nAnd she died singing it. That song tonight\nWill not go from my mind. I have much to do\nBut to go hang my head all at one side\nAnd sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee, dispatch.\n\nEMILIA  Shall I go fetch your nightgown?\n\nDESDEMONA  No, unpin me here.\nThis Lodovico is a proper man.\n\nEMILIA  A very handsome man.\n\nDESDEMONA  He speaks well.\n\nEMILIA  I know a lady in Venice would have walked\nbarefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.\n\nDESDEMONA, [singing]\n\tThe poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,\n\t   Sing all a green willow.\n\tHer hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,\n\t   Sing willow, willow, willow.\n\tThe fresh streams ran by her and murmured her\nmoans,\n\t   Sing willow, willow, willow;\n\tHer salt tears fell from her, and softened the\nstones--\nLay by these.\n\t   Sing willow, willow, willow.\nPrithee hie thee! He'll come anon.\n\tSing all a green willow must be my garland.\n\tLet nobody blame him, his scorn I approve.\nNay, that's not next. Hark, who is 't that knocks?\n\nEMILIA  It's the wind.\n\nDESDEMONA\n\tI called my love false love, but what said he then?\n\t   Sing willow, willow, willow.\n\tIf I court more women, you'll couch with more\nmen.--\nSo, get thee gone. Good night. Mine eyes do itch;\nDoth that bode weeping?\n\nEMILIA  'Tis neither here nor there.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI have heard it said so. O these men, these men!\nDost thou in conscience think--tell me, Emilia--\nThat there be women do abuse their husbands\nIn such gross kind?\n\nEMILIA  There be some such, no\nquestion.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?\n\nEMILIA\nWhy, would not you?\n\nDESDEMONA  No, by this heavenly light!\n\nEMILIA\nNor I neither, by this heavenly light.\nI might do 't as well i' th' dark.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?\n\nEMILIA  The world's a huge thing. It is a great price\nfor a small vice.\n\nDESDEMONA  In troth, I think thou wouldst not.\n\nEMILIA  In troth, I think I should, and undo 't when I\nhad done it. Marry, I would not do such a thing for\na joint ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for\ngowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition.\nBut for the whole world--'Uds pity! Who\nwould not make her husband a cuckold to make\nhim a monarch? I should venture purgatory for 't.\n\nDESDEMONA  Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong\nfor the whole world!\n\nEMILIA  Why, the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world;\nand, having the world for your labor, 'tis a wrong in\nyour own world, and you might quickly make it\nright.\n\nDESDEMONA  I do not think there is any such woman.\n\nEMILIA  Yes, a dozen; and as many to th' vantage as\nwould store the world they played for.\nBut I do think it is their husbands' faults\nIf wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,\nAnd pour our treasures into foreign laps;\nOr else break out in peevish jealousies,\nThrowing restraint upon us. Or say they strike us,\nOr scant our former having in despite.\nWhy, we have galls, and though we have some grace,\nYet have we some revenge. Let husbands know\nTheir wives have sense like them. They see, and\nsmell,\nAnd have their palates both for sweet and sour,\nAs husbands have. What is it that they do\nWhen they change us for others? Is it sport?\nI think it is. And doth affection breed it?\nI think it doth. Is 't frailty that thus errs?\nIt is so too. And have not we affections,\nDesires for sport, and frailty, as men have?\nThen let them use us well. Else let them know,\nThe ills we do, their ills instruct us so.\n\nDESDEMONA\nGood night, good night. God me such uses send,\nNot to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 5\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Iago and Roderigo.]\n\n\nIAGO\nHere, stand behind this bulk. Straight will he\ncome.\nWear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.\nQuick, quick! Fear nothing. I'll be at thy elbow.\nIt makes us or it mars us--think on that,\nAnd fix most firm thy resolution.\n\nRODERIGO\nBe near at hand. I may miscarry in 't.\n\nIAGO\nHere, at thy hand. Be bold and take thy stand.\n[He moves aside.]\n\nRODERIGO\nI have no great devotion to the deed,\nAnd yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.\n'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword! He dies.\n[He draws his sword.]\n\nIAGO, [aside]\nI have rubbed this young quat almost to the sense,\nAnd he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,\nOr Cassio him, or each do kill the other,\nEvery way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,\nHe calls me to a restitution large\nOf gold and jewels that I bobbed from him\nAs gifts to Desdemona.\nIt must not be. If Cassio do remain,\nHe hath a daily beauty in his life\nThat makes me ugly. And besides, the Moor\nMay unfold me to him. There stand I in much peril.\nNo, he must die. Be 't so. I hear him coming.\n\n[Enter Cassio.]\n\n\nRODERIGO\nI know his gait. 'Tis he!--Villain, thou diest!\n[He thrusts at Cassio.]\n\nCASSIO\nThat thrust had been mine enemy indeed\nBut that my coat is better than thou know'st.\nI will make proof of thine.\n[He draws, and stabs Roderigo.]\n\nRODERIGO  O, I am slain!\n[Roderigo falls.]\n[Iago stabs Cassio in the leg, and exits.]\n\nCASSIO\nI am maimed forever! Help, ho! Murder, murder!\n\n[Enter Othello.]\n\n\nOTHELLO\nThe voice of Cassio! Iago keeps his word.\n\nRODERIGO  O, villain that I am!\n\nOTHELLO, [aside]  It is even so.\n\nCASSIO  O, help ho! Light! A surgeon!\n\nOTHELLO, [aside]\n'Tis he! O brave Iago, honest and just,\nThat hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!\nThou teachest me.--Minion, your dear lies dead,\nAnd your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come.\nForth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are\nblotted.\nThy bed, lust-stained, shall with lust's blood be\nspotted.\t[Othello exits.]\n\n[Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.]\n\n\nCASSIO\nWhat ho! No watch? No passage? Murder, murder!\n\nGRATIANO\n'Tis some mischance. The voice is very direful.\n\nCASSIO  O, help!\n\nLODOVICO  Hark!\n\nRODERIGO  O wretched villain!\n\nLODOVICO\nTwo or three groan. 'Tis heavy night.\nThese may be counterfeits. Let's think 't unsafe\nTo come in to the cry without more help.\n\nRODERIGO\nNobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.\n\n[Enter Iago with a light.]\n\n\nLODOVICO  Hark!\n\nGRATIANO\nHere's one comes in his shirt, with light and\nweapons.\n\nIAGO\nWho's there? Whose noise is this that cries on\nmurder?\n\nLODOVICO\nWe do not know.\n\nIAGO  Did not you hear a cry?\n\nCASSIO\nHere, here! For heaven's sake, help me!\n\nIAGO  What's the matter?\n\nGRATIANO, [to Lodovico]\nThis is Othello's ancient, as I take it.\n\nLODOVICO\nThe same indeed, a very valiant fellow.\n\nIAGO, [to Cassio]\nWhat are you here that cry so grievously?\n\nCASSIO\nIago? O, I am spoiled, undone by villains.\nGive me some help!\n\nIAGO\nO me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?\n\nCASSIO\nI think that one of them is hereabout\nAnd cannot make away.\n\nIAGO  O treacherous villains!\n[To Lodovico and Gratiano.] What are you there?\nCome in, and give some help.\n\nRODERIGO  O, help me here!\n\nCASSIO\nThat's one of them.\n\nIAGO, [to Roderigo]  O murd'rous slave! O villain!\n[He stabs Roderigo.]\n\nRODERIGO\nO damned Iago! O inhuman dog!\n\nIAGO\nKill men i' th' dark?--Where be these bloody\nthieves?\nHow silent is this town! Ho, murder, murder!--\nWhat may you be? Are you of good or evil?\n\nLODOVICO\nAs you shall prove us, praise us.\n\nIAGO  Signior Lodovico?\n\nLODOVICO  He, sir.\n\nIAGO\nI cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.\n\nGRATIANO  Cassio?\n\nIAGO\nHow is 't, brother?\n\nCASSIO  My leg is cut in two.\n\nIAGO  Marry, heaven forbid!\nLight, gentlemen. I'll bind it with my shirt.\n\n[Enter Bianca.]\n\n\nBIANCA\nWhat is the matter, ho? Who is 't that cried?\n\nIAGO\nWho is 't that cried?\n\nBIANCA  O, my dear Cassio,\nMy sweet Cassio! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!\n\nIAGO\nO notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect\nWho they should be that have thus mangled you?\n\nCASSIO  No.\n\nGRATIANO\nI am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.\n\nIAGO\nLend me a garter. So.--O for a chair\nTo bear him easily hence!\n\nBIANCA\nAlas, he faints. O, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!\n\nIAGO\nGentlemen all, I do suspect this trash\nTo be a party in this injury.--\nPatience awhile, good Cassio.--Come, come;\nLend me a light. [Peering at Roderigo.] Know we this\nface or no?\nAlas, my friend and my dear countryman\nRoderigo? No! Yes, sure. O heaven, Roderigo!\n\nGRATIANO  What, of Venice?\n\nIAGO  Even he, sir. Did you know him?\n\nGRATIANO  Know him? Ay.\n\nIAGO\nSignior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon.\nThese bloody accidents must excuse my manners\nThat so neglected you.\n\nGRATIANO  I am glad to see you.\n\nIAGO\nHow do you, Cassio?--O, a chair, a chair!\n\nGRATIANO  Roderigo?\n\nIAGO\nHe, he, 'tis he! [A chair is brought in.] O, that's well\nsaid; the chair.--\nSome good man bear him carefully from hence.\nI'll fetch the General's surgeon.-- For you, mistress,\nSave you your labor.--He that lies slain here,\nCassio,\nWas my dear friend. What malice was between you?\n\nCASSIO\nNone in the world. Nor do I know the man.\n\nIAGO, [to Bianca]\nWhat, look you pale?--O, bear him out o' th' air.\n[Cassio, in the chair, and Roderigo are carried off.]\n[To Gratiano and Lodovico.] Stay you, good\ngentlemen.--Look you pale, mistress?--\nDo you perceive the gastness of her eye?--\nNay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.--\nBehold her well. I pray you, look upon her.\nDo you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak\nThough tongues were out of use.\n\n[Enter Emilia.]\n\n\nEMILIA\nAlas, what is the matter? What is the matter,\nhusband?\n\nIAGO\nCassio hath here been set on in the dark\nBy Roderigo and fellows that are scaped.\nHe's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.\n\nEMILIA\nAlas, good gentleman! Alas, good Cassio!\n\nIAGO\nThis is the fruits of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,\nGo know of Cassio where he supped tonight.\n[To Bianca.] What, do you shake at that?\n\nBIANCA\nHe supped at my house, but I therefore shake not.\n\nIAGO\nO, did he so? I charge you go with me.\n\nEMILIA  O fie upon thee, strumpet!\n\nBIANCA\nI am no strumpet, but of life as honest\nAs you that thus abuse me.\n\nEMILIA  As I? Faugh! Fie upon thee!\n\nIAGO\nKind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dressed.--\nCome, mistress, you must tell 's another tale.--\nEmilia, run you to the citadel\nAnd tell my lord and lady what hath happed.--\nWill you go on afore? [Aside.] This is the night\nThat either makes me or fordoes me quite.\n[They exit in different directions.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Othello with a light, and Desdemona in her bed.]\n\n\nOTHELLO\nIt is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.\nLet me not name it to you, you chaste stars.\nIt is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood,\nNor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,\nAnd smooth as monumental alabaster.\nYet she must die, else she'll betray more men.\nPut out the light, and then put out the light.\nIf I quench thee, thou flaming minister,\nI can again thy former light restore\nShould I repent me. But once put out thy light,\nThou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,\nI know not where is that Promethean heat\nThat can thy light relume. When I have plucked the\nrose,\nI cannot give it vital growth again.\nIt needs must wither. I'll smell it on the tree.\nO balmy breath, that dost almost persuade\nJustice to break her sword! [He kisses her.] One\nmore, one more.\nBe thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee\nAnd love thee after. One more, and this the last.\n[He kisses her.]\nSo sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,\nBut they are cruel tears. This sorrow's heavenly:\nIt strikes where it doth love. She wakes.\n\nDESDEMONA\nWho's there? Othello?\n\nOTHELLO  Ay, Desdemona.\n\nDESDEMONA  Will you come to bed, my lord?\n\nOTHELLO\nHave you prayed tonight, Desdemon?\n\nDESDEMONA  Ay, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO\nIf you bethink yourself of any crime\nUnreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,\nSolicit for it straight.\n\nDESDEMONA  Alack, my lord,\nWhat may you mean by that?\n\nOTHELLO\nWell, do it, and be brief. I will walk by.\nI would not kill thy unprepared spirit.\nNo, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.\n\nDESDEMONA  Talk you of killing?\n\nOTHELLO\nAy, I do.\n\nDESDEMONA  Then heaven have mercy on me.\n\nOTHELLO  Amen, with all my heart.\n\nDESDEMONA\nIf you say so, I hope you will not kill me.\n\nOTHELLO  Humh.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAnd yet I fear you, for you're fatal then\nWhen your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know\nnot,\nSince guiltiness I know not, but yet I feel I fear.\n\nOTHELLO\nThink on thy sins.\n\nDESDEMONA  They are loves I bear to you.\n\nOTHELLO  Ay, and for that thou diest.\n\nDESDEMONA\nThat death's unnatural that kills for loving.\nAlas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?\nSome bloody passion shakes your very frame.\nThese are portents, but yet I hope, I hope\nThey do not point on me.\n\nOTHELLO  Peace, and be still.\n\nDESDEMONA\nI will so. What's the matter?\n\nOTHELLO  That handkerchief\nWhich I so loved, and gave thee, thou gav'st to\nCassio.\n\nDESDEMONA\nNo, by my life and soul! Send for the man\nAnd ask him.\n\nOTHELLO\nSweet soul, take heed, take heed of perjury.\nThou art on thy deathbed.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAy, but not yet to die.\n\nOTHELLO  Yes, presently.\nTherefore confess thee freely of thy sin.\nFor to deny each article with oath\nCannot remove nor choke the strong conception\nThat I do groan withal. Thou art to die.\n\nDESDEMONA\nThen Lord have mercy on me!\n\nOTHELLO  I say \"Amen.\"\n\nDESDEMONA\nAnd have you mercy, too. I never did\nOffend you in my life, never loved Cassio\nBut with such general warranty of heaven\nAs I might love. I never gave him token.\n\nOTHELLO\nBy heaven, I saw my handkerchief in 's hand!\nO perjured woman, thou dost stone my heart\nAnd mak'st me call what I intend to do\nA murder, which I thought a sacrifice!\nI saw the handkerchief!\n\nDESDEMONA  He found it, then.\nI never gave it him.

Unlawfully?\n\nOTHELLO  Ay.\n\nDESDEMONA\nHe will not say so.\n\nOTHELLO  No. His mouth is stopped.\nHonest Iago hath ta'en order for 't.\n\nDESDEMONA\nO, my fear interprets. What, is he dead?\n\nOTHELLO\nHad all his hairs been lives, my great revenge\nHad stomach for them all.\n\nDESDEMONA\nAlas, he is betrayed, and I undone.\t[She weeps.]\n\nOTHELLO\nOut, strumpet! Weep'st thou for him to my face?\n\nDESDEMONA\nO banish me, my lord, but kill me not!\n\nOTHELLO  Down, strumpet!\n\nDESDEMONA\nKill me tomorrow, let me live tonight.\n\nOTHELLO  Nay, if you strive--\n\nDESDEMONA\nBut half an hour!\n\nOTHELLO  Being done, there is no pause.\n\nDESDEMONA\nBut while I say one prayer!\n\nOTHELLO  It is too late.\n[He smothers her.]\n\nEMILIA, [within]\nMy lord, my lord? What ho! My lord, my lord!\n\nOTHELLO\nWhat noise is this?--Not dead? Not yet quite dead?\nI that am cruel am yet merciful.\nI would not have thee linger in thy pain.\nSo, so.\n\nEMILIA, [within]  What, ho! My lord, my lord!\n\nOTHELLO  Who's\nthere?\n\nEMILIA, [within]\nO, good my lord, I would speak a word with you.\n\nOTHELLO\nYes. 'Tis Emilia.--By and by.--She's dead.\n'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.\nThe noise was here. Ha, no more moving?\nStill as the grave. Shall she come in? Were 't good?\nI think she stirs again. No. What's best to do?\nIf she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife.\nMy wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.\nO insupportable! O heavy hour!\nMethinks it should be now a huge eclipse\nOf sun and moon, and that th' affrighted globe\nShould yawn at alteration.\n\nEMILIA, [within]  I do beseech you\nThat I may speak with you. O, good my lord--\n\nOTHELLO\nI had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.--\nSoft, by and by, let me the curtains draw.--\nWhere art thou?\n\n[Enter Emilia.]\n\nWhat's the matter with thee now?\n\nEMILIA\nO, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done.\n\nOTHELLO  What? Now?\n\nEMILIA  But now, my lord.\n\nOTHELLO\nIt is the very error of the moon.\nShe comes more nearer Earth than she was wont\nAnd makes men mad.\n\nEMILIA  Cassio, my lord, hath killed\nA young Venetian called Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO\nRoderigo killed? And Cassio killed?\n\nEMILIA  No, Cassio is not killed.\n\nOTHELLO\nNot Cassio killed? Then murder's out of tune,\nAnd sweet revenge grows harsh.\n\nDESDEMONA  O falsely, falsely murdered.\n\nEMILIA\nO Lord, what cry is that?\n\nOTHELLO  That? What?\n\nEMILIA\nOut, and alas, that was my lady's voice!\nHelp! Help ho! Help! O lady, speak again!\nSweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!\n\nDESDEMONA  A guiltless death I die.\n\nEMILIA  O, who hath done this deed?\n\nDESDEMONA  Nobody. I myself. Farewell.\nCommend me to my kind lord. O, farewell.\n[She dies.]\n\nOTHELLO\nWhy, how should she be murdered?\n\nEMILIA  Alas, who\nknows?\n\nOTHELLO\nYou heard her say herself, it was not I.\n\nEMILIA\nShe said so. I must needs report the truth.\n\nOTHELLO\nShe's like a liar gone to burning hell!\n'Twas I that killed her.\n\nEMILIA\nO, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!\n\nOTHELLO\nShe turned to folly, and she was a whore.\n\nEMILIA\nThou dost belie her, and thou art a devil!\n\nOTHELLO  She was false as water.\n\nEMILIA  Thou art rash as fire to say\nThat she was false. O, she was heavenly true!\n\nOTHELLO\nCassio did top her. Ask thy husband else.\nO, I were damned beneath all depth in hell\nBut that I did proceed upon just grounds\nTo this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.\n\nEMILIA  My husband?\n\nOTHELLO  Thy husband.\n\nEMILIA  That she was false to wedlock?\n\nOTHELLO\nAy, with Cassio. Had she been true,\nIf heaven would make me such another world\nOf one entire and perfect chrysolite,\nI'd not have sold her for it.\n\nEMILIA  My husband?\n\nOTHELLO\nAy, 'twas he that told me on her first.\nAn honest man he is, and hates the slime\nThat sticks on filthy deeds.\n\nEMILIA  My husband?\n\nOTHELLO\nWhat needs this iterance, woman? I say, thy\nhusband.\n\nEMILIA\nO mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!--\nMy husband say she was false?\n\nOTHELLO  He, woman.\nI say thy husband. Dost understand the word?\nMy friend, thy husband; honest, honest Iago.\n\nEMILIA\nIf he say so, may his pernicious soul\nRot half a grain a day! He lies to th' heart!\nShe was too fond of her most filthy bargain.\n[He draws his sword.]\n\nOTHELLO  Hah?\n\nEMILIA  Do thy worst!\nThis deed of thine is no more worthy heaven\nThan thou wast worthy her.\n\nOTHELLO  Peace, you were best!\n\nEMILIA\nThou hast not half that power to do me harm\nAs I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt,\nAs ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed--\nI care not for thy sword. I'll make thee known,\nThough I lost twenty lives. Help! Help, ho! Help!\nThe Moor hath killed my mistress! Murder, murder!\n\n[Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago.]\n\n\nMONTANO\nWhat is the matter? How now, general?\n\nEMILIA\nO, are you come, Iago? You have done well,\nThat men must lay their murders on your neck.\n\nGRATIANO  What is the matter?\n\nEMILIA, [to Iago]\nDisprove this villain, if thou be'st a man.\nHe says thou told'st him that his wife was false.\nI know thou didst not. Thou 'rt not such a villain.\nSpeak, for my heart is full.\n\nIAGO\nI told him what I thought, and told no more\nThan what he found himself was apt and true.\n\nEMILIA\nBut did you ever tell him she was false?\n\nIAGO  I did.\n\nEMILIA\nYou told a lie, an odious, damned lie!\nUpon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie!\nShe false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?\n\nIAGO\nWith Cassio, mistress. Go to! Charm your tongue.\n\nEMILIA\nI will not charm my tongue. I am bound to speak.\nMy mistress here lies murdered in her bed.\n\nALL  O heavens forfend!\n\nEMILIA, [to Iago]\nAnd your reports have set the murder on!\n\nOTHELLO\nNay, stare not, masters; it is true indeed.\n\nGRATIANO  'Tis a strange truth.\n\nMONTANO\nO monstrous act!\n\nEMILIA  Villainy, villainy, villainy!\nI think upon 't, I think! I smell 't! O villainy!\nI thought so then. I'll kill myself for grief!\nO villainy! Villainy!\n\nIAGO\nWhat, are you mad? I charge you get you home.\n\nEMILIA\nGood gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.\n'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.\nPerchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.\n\nOTHELLO\nO, O, O!\t[Othello falls on the bed.]\n\nEMILIA  Nay, lay thee down, and roar!\nFor thou hast killed the sweetest innocent\nThat e'er did lift up eye.\n\nOTHELLO, [standing]  O, she was foul!--\nI scarce did know you, uncle. There lies your niece,\nWhose breath indeed these hands have newly\nstopped.\nI know this act shows horrible and grim.\n\nGRATIANO\nPoor Desdemon, I am glad thy father's dead.\nThy match was mortal to him, and pure grief\nShore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,\nThis sight would make him do a desperate turn,\nYea, curse his better angel from his side,\nAnd fall to reprobance.\n\nOTHELLO\n'Tis pitiful. But yet Iago knows\nThat she with Cassio hath the act of shame\nA thousand times committed. Cassio confessed it,\nAnd she did gratify his amorous works\nWith that recognizance and pledge of love\nWhich I first gave her. I saw it in his hand.\nIt was a handkerchief, an antique token\nMy father gave my mother.\n\nEMILIA  O God! O heavenly God!\n\nIAGO\nZounds, hold your peace!\n\nEMILIA  'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace?\nNo, I will speak as liberal as the north.\nLet heaven and men and devils, let them all,\nAll, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.\n\nIAGO  Be wise, and get you home.\n[He draws his sword.]\n\nEMILIA\nI will not.\n\nGRATIANO  Fie, your sword upon a woman!\n\nEMILIA\nO thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak'st\nof\nI found by fortune, and did give my husband--\nFor often, with a solemn earnestness\n(More than indeed belonged to such a trifle),\nHe begged of me to steal 't.\n\nIAGO  Villainous whore!\n\nEMILIA\nShe give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,\nAnd I did give 't my husband.\n\nIAGO  Filth, thou liest!\n\nEMILIA\nBy heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen!\n[To Othello.] O murd'rous coxcomb, what should\nsuch a fool\nDo with so good a wife?\n\nOTHELLO  Are there no stones in heaven\nBut what serves for the thunder?--Precious villain!\n[The Moor runs at Iago but is disarmed.]\n[Iago kills his wife.]\n\nGRATIANO\nThe woman falls! Sure he hath killed his wife.\n\nEMILIA\nAy, ay! O, lay me by my mistress' side.\t[Iago exits.]\n\nGRATIANO  He's gone, but his wife's killed.\n\nMONTANO\n'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon\nWhich I have here recovered from the Moor.\nCome, guard the door without. Let him not pass,\nBut kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,\nFor 'tis a damned slave.\n[Montano and Gratiano exit.]\n\nOTHELLO  I am not valiant neither,\nBut every puny whipster gets my sword.\nBut why should honor outlive honesty?\nLet it go all.\n\nEMILIA  What did thy song bode, lady?\nHark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan\nAnd die in music.\n[She sings.]\tWillow, willow, willow.\nMoor, she was chaste. She loved thee, cruel Moor.\nSo come my soul to bliss, as I speak true.\nSo speaking as I think, alas, I die. \t[She dies.]\n\nOTHELLO\nI have another weapon in this chamber.\nIt is a sword of Spain, the ice brook's temper.\nO, here it is.--Uncle, I must come forth.\n\nGRATIANO, [within]\nIf thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear;\nThou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer.\n\nOTHELLO\nLook in upon me, then, and speak with me,\nOr naked as I am I will assault thee.\n\n[Enter Gratiano.]\n\n\nGRATIANO\nWhat is the matter?\n\nOTHELLO  Behold, I have a weapon.\nA better never did itself sustain\nUpon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day\nThat with this little arm and this good sword\nI have made my way through more impediments\nThan twenty times your stop. But--O vain boast!--\nWho can control his fate? 'Tis not so now.\nBe not afraid, though you do see me weaponed.\nHere is my journey's end, here is my butt\nAnd very sea-mark of my utmost sail.\nDo you go back dismayed? 'Tis a lost fear.\nMan but a rush against Othello's breast,\nAnd he retires. Where should Othello go?\n[He looks toward the bed.]\nNow, how dost thou look now? O ill-starred wench,\nPale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,\nThis look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,\nAnd fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?\nEven like thy chastity.--O cursed, cursed slave!--\nWhip me, you devils,\nFrom the possession of this heavenly sight!\nBlow me about in winds, roast me in sulfur,\nWash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!\nO Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead! O, O!\n\n [Enter Lodovico, Cassio in a chair, Montano, and Iago,\nwith Officers.]\n\n\nLODOVICO\nWhere is this rash and most unfortunate man?\n\nOTHELLO\nThat's he that was Othello. Here I am.\n\nLODOVICO\nWhere is that viper? Bring the villain forth.\n[Iago is brought forward.]\n\nOTHELLO\nI look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.--\nIf that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.\n[He stabs Iago.]\n\nLODOVICO\nWrench his sword from him.\n[Othello is disarmed.]\n\nIAGO  I bleed, sir, but not killed.\n\nOTHELLO\nI am not sorry neither. I'd have thee live,\nFor in my sense 'tis happiness to die.\n\nLODOVICO\nO thou Othello, that wert once so good,\nFall'n in the practice of a damned slave,\nWhat shall be said to thee?\n\nOTHELLO  Why, anything.\nAn honorable murderer, if you will,\nFor naught I did in hate, but all in honor.\n\nLODOVICO\nThis wretch hath part confessed his villainy.\nDid you and he consent in Cassio's death?\n\nOTHELLO  Ay.\n\nCASSIO\nDear general, I never gave you cause.\n\nOTHELLO\nI do believe it, and I ask your pardon.\nWill you, I pray, demand that demi-devil\nWhy he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?\n\nIAGO\nDemand me nothing. What you know, you know.\nFrom this time forth I never will speak word.\n\nLODOVICO  What? Not to pray?\n\nGRATIANO  Torments will ope your lips.\n\nOTHELLO  Well, thou dost best.\n\nLODOVICO  Sir,\nYou shall understand what hath befall'n,\nWhich, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter\nFound in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,\nAnd here another. [He shows papers.] The one of\nthem imports\nThe death of Cassio, to be undertook\nBy Roderigo.\n\nOTHELLO\nO villain!\n\nCASSIO  Most heathenish and most gross.\n\nLODOVICO\nNow here's another discontented paper\nFound in his pocket, too; and this it seems\nRoderigo meant t' have sent this damned villain,\nBut that, belike, Iago in the interim\nCame in and satisfied him.\n\nOTHELLO  O, thou pernicious caitiff!--\nHow came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief\nThat was my wife's?\n\nCASSIO  I found it in my chamber.\nAnd he himself confessed it but even now,\nThat there he dropped it for a special purpose\nWhich wrought to his desire.\n\nOTHELLO  O fool, fool, fool!\n\nCASSIO\nThere is besides, in Roderigo's letter,\nHow he upbraids Iago, that he made him\nBrave me upon the watch, whereon it came\nThat I was cast. And even but now he spake,\nAfter long seeming dead: Iago hurt him,\nIago set him on.\n\nLODOVICO, [to Othello]\nYou must forsake this room and go with us.\nYour power and your command is taken off,\nAnd Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,\nIf there be any cunning cruelty\nThat can torment him much and hold him long,\nIt shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,\nTill that the nature of your fault be known\nTo the Venetian state.--Come, bring away.\n\nOTHELLO\nSoft you. A word or two before you go.\nI have done the state some service, and they\nknow 't.\nNo more of that. I pray you in your letters,\nWhen you shall these unlucky deeds relate,\nSpeak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,\nNor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak\nOf one that loved not wisely, but too well;\nOf one not easily jealous, but being wrought,\nPerplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand,\nLike the base Judean, threw a pearl away\nRicher than all his tribe; of one whose subdued\neyes,\nAlbeit unused to the melting mood,\nDrops tears as fast as the Arabian trees\nTheir medicinable gum. Set you down this.\nAnd say besides, that in Aleppo once,\nWhere a malignant and a turbanned Turk\nBeat a Venetian and traduced the state,\nI took by th' throat the circumcised dog,\nAnd smote him, thus.\t[He stabs himself.]\n\nLODOVICO  O bloody period!\n\nGRATIANO  All that is spoke is marred.\n\nOTHELLO, [to Desdemona]\nI kissed thee ere I killed thee. No way but this,\nKilling myself, to die upon a kiss.\t[He dies.]\n\nCASSIO\nThis did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,\nFor he was great of heart.\n\nLODOVICO, [to Iago]  O Spartan dog,\nMore fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,\nLook on the tragic loading of this bed.\nThis is thy work.--The object poisons sight.\nLet it be hid.--Gratiano, keep the house,\nAnd seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,\nFor they succeed on you. [To Cassio.] To you, lord\ngovernor,\nRemains the censure of this hellish villain.\nThe time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it.\nMyself will straight aboard, and to the state\nThis heavy act with heavy heart relate.\n[They exit.]\n",

I have so often blushed to acknowledge\nhim that now I am brazed to 't.\n\nKENT  I cannot conceive you.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Sir, this young fellow's mother could,\nwhereupon she grew round-wombed and had indeed,\nsir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband\nfor her bed. Do you smell a fault?\n\nKENT  I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it\nbeing so proper.\n\nGLOUCESTER  But I have a son, sir, by order of law,\nsome year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in\nmy account. Though this knave came something\nsaucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was\nhis mother fair, there was good sport at his making,\nand the whoreson must be acknowledged.--Do you\nknow this noble gentleman, Edmund?\n\nEDMUND  No, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER  My lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter\nas my honorable friend.\n\nEDMUND  My services to your Lordship.\n\nKENT  I must love you and sue to know you better.\n\nEDMUND  Sir, I shall study deserving.\n\nGLOUCESTER  He hath been out nine years, and away he\nshall again. [(Sennet.)] The King is coming.\n\n[Enter King Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan,\nCordelia, and Attendants.]\n\n\nLEAR\nAttend the lords of France and Burgundy,\nGloucester.\n\nGLOUCESTER  I shall, my lord.\t[He exits.]\n\nLEAR\nMeantime we shall express our darker purpose.--\nGive me the map there.\t[He is handed a map.]\nKnow that we have divided\nIn three our kingdom, and 'tis our fast intent\nTo shake all cares and business from our age,\nConferring them on younger strengths, while we\nUnburdened crawl toward death. Our son of\nCornwall\nAnd you, our no less loving son of Albany,\nWe have this hour a constant will to publish\nOur daughters' several dowers, that future strife\nMay be prevented now.\nThe two great princes, France and Burgundy,\nGreat rivals in our youngest daughter's love,\nLong in our court have made their amorous sojourn\nAnd here are to be answered. Tell me, my\ndaughters--\nSince now we will divest us both of rule,\nInterest of territory, cares of state--\nWhich of you shall we say doth love us most,\nThat we our largest bounty may extend\nWhere nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,\nOur eldest born, speak first.\n\nGONERIL\nSir, I love you more than word can wield the\nmatter,\nDearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,\nBeyond what can be valued, rich or rare,\nNo less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;\nAs much as child e'er loved, or father found;\nA love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.\nBeyond all manner of so much I love you.\n\nCORDELIA, [aside]\nWhat shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.\n\nLEAR, [pointing to the map]\nOf all these bounds, even from this line to this,\nWith shadowy forests and with champains riched,\nWith plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\nWe make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue\nBe this perpetual.--What says our second\ndaughter,\nOur dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak.\n\nREGAN\nI am made of that self mettle as my sister\nAnd prize me at her worth. In my true heart\nI find she names my very deed of love;\nOnly she comes too short, that I profess\nMyself an enemy to all other joys\nWhich the most precious square of sense\npossesses,\nAnd find I am alone felicitate\nIn your dear Highness' love.\n\nCORDELIA, [aside]  Then poor Cordelia!\nAnd yet not so, since I am sure my love's\nMore ponderous than my tongue.\n\nLEAR\nTo thee and thine hereditary ever\nRemain this ample third of our fair kingdom,\nNo less in space, validity, and pleasure\nThan that conferred on Goneril.--Now, our joy,\nAlthough our last and least, to whose young love\nThe vines of France and milk of Burgundy\nStrive to be interessed, what can you say to draw\nA third more opulent than your sisters'? Speak.\n\nCORDELIA  Nothing, my lord.\n\nLEAR  Nothing?\n\nCORDELIA  Nothing.\n\nLEAR\nNothing will come of nothing. Speak again.\n\nCORDELIA\nUnhappy that I am, I cannot heave\nMy heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty\nAccording to my bond, no more nor less.\n\nLEAR\nHow, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,\nLest you may mar your fortunes.\n\nCORDELIA  Good my lord,\nYou have begot me, bred me, loved me.\nI return those duties back as are right fit:\nObey you, love you, and most honor you.\nWhy have my sisters husbands if they say\nThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\nThat lord whose hand must take my plight shall\ncarry\nHalf my love with him, half my care and duty.\nSure I shall never marry like my sisters,\nTo love my father all.\n\nLEAR  But goes thy heart with this?\n\nCORDELIA  Ay, my good lord.\n\nLEAR  So young and so untender?\n\nCORDELIA  So young, my lord, and true.\n\nLEAR\nLet it be so. Thy truth, then, be thy dower,\nFor by the sacred radiance of the sun,\nThe mysteries of Hecate and the night,\nBy all the operation of the orbs\nFrom whom we do exist and cease to be,\nHere I disclaim all my paternal care,\nPropinquity, and property of blood,\nAnd as a stranger to my heart and me\nHold thee from this forever. The barbarous\nScythian,\nOr he that makes his generation messes\nTo gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\nBe as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved\nAs thou my sometime daughter.\n\nKENT  Good my liege--\n\nLEAR  Peace, Kent.\nCome not between the dragon and his wrath.\nI loved her most and thought to set my rest\nOn her kind nursery. [To Cordelia.] Hence and avoid\nmy sight!--\nSo be my grave my peace as here I give\nHer father's heart from her.--Call France. Who stirs?\nCall Burgundy. [An Attendant exits.] Cornwall and\nAlbany,\nWith my two daughters' dowers digest the third.\nLet pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\nI do invest you jointly with my power,\nPreeminence, and all the large effects\nThat troop with majesty. Ourself by monthly course,\nWith reservation of an hundred knights\nBy you to be sustained, shall our abode\nMake with you by due turn. Only we shall retain\nThe name and all th' addition to a king.\nThe sway, revenue, execution of the rest,\nBeloved sons, be yours, which to confirm,\nThis coronet part between you.\n\nKENT  Royal Lear,\nWhom I have ever honored as my king,\nLoved as my father, as my master followed,\nAs my great patron thought on in my prayers--\n\nLEAR\nThe bow is bent and drawn. Make from the shaft.\n\nKENT\nLet it fall rather, though the fork invade\nThe region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly\nWhen Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?\nThink'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak\nWhen power to flattery bows? To plainness honor's\nbound\nWhen majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,\nAnd in thy best consideration check\nThis hideous rashness. Answer my life my\njudgment,\nThy youngest daughter does not love thee least,\nNor are those empty-hearted whose low sounds\nReverb no hollowness.\n\nLEAR  Kent, on thy life, no more.\n\nKENT\nMy life I never held but as a pawn\nTo wage against thine enemies, nor fear to lose\nit,\nThy safety being motive.\n\nLEAR  Out of my sight!\n\nKENT\nSee better, Lear, and let me still remain\nThe true blank of thine eye.\n\nLEAR  Now, by Apollo--\n\nKENT  Now, by Apollo, king,\nThou swear'st thy gods in vain.\n\nLEAR  O vassal! Miscreant!\n\nALBANY/CORNWALL  Dear sir, forbear.\n\nKENT\nKill thy physician, and thy fee bestow\nUpon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,\nOr whilst I can vent clamor from my throat,\nI'll tell thee thou dost evil.\n\nLEAR\nHear me, recreant; on thine allegiance, hear me!\nThat thou hast sought to make us break our vows--\nWhich we durst never yet--and with strained pride\nTo come betwixt our sentence and our power,\nWhich nor our nature nor our place can bear,\nOur potency made good, take thy reward:\nFive days we do allot thee for provision\nTo shield thee from disasters of the world,\nAnd on the sixth to turn thy hated back\nUpon our kingdom. If on the tenth day following\nThy banished trunk be found in our dominions,\nThe moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\nThis shall not be revoked.\n\nKENT\nFare thee well, king. Sith thus thou wilt appear,\nFreedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\n[To Cordelia.] The gods to their dear shelter take\nthee, maid,\nThat justly think'st and hast most rightly said.\n[To Goneril and Regan.] And your large speeches\nmay your deeds approve,\nThat good effects may spring from words of love.--\nThus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu.\nHe'll shape his old course in a country new.\n[He exits.]\n\n[Flourish. Enter Gloucester with France, and Burgundy,\nand Attendants.]\n\n\nGLOUCESTER\nHere's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\n\nLEAR  My lord of Burgundy,\nWe first address toward you, who with this king\nHath rivaled for our daughter. What in the least\nWill you require in present dower with her,\nOr cease your quest of love?\n\nBURGUNDY  Most royal Majesty,\nI crave no more than hath your Highness offered,\nNor will you tender less.\n\nLEAR  Right noble Burgundy,\nWhen she was dear to us, we did hold her so,\nBut now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands.\nIf aught within that little seeming substance,\nOr all of it, with our displeasure pieced\nAnd nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,\nShe's there, and she is yours.\n\nBURGUNDY  I know no answer.\n\nLEAR\nWill you, with those infirmities she owes,\nUnfriended, new-adopted to our hate,\nDowered with our curse and strangered with our\noath,\nTake her or leave her?\n\nBURGUNDY  Pardon me, royal sir,\nElection makes not up in such conditions.\n\nLEAR\nThen leave her, sir, for by the power that made me\nI tell you all her wealth.--For you, great king,\nI would not from your love make such a stray\nTo match you where I hate. Therefore beseech you\nT' avert your liking a more worthier way\nThan on a wretch whom Nature is ashamed\nAlmost t' acknowledge hers.\n\nFRANCE  This is most strange,\nThat she whom even but now was your best\nobject,\nThe argument of your praise, balm of your age,\nThe best, the dearest, should in this trice of time\nCommit a thing so monstrous to dismantle\nSo many folds of favor. Sure her offense\nMust be of such unnatural degree\nThat monsters it, or your forevouched affection\nFall into taint; which to believe of her\nMust be a faith that reason without miracle\nShould never plant in me.\n\nCORDELIA, [to Lear]  I yet beseech your Majesty--\nIf for I want that glib and oily art\nTo speak and purpose not, since what I well\nintend\nI'll do 't before I speak--that you make known\nIt is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,\nNo unchaste action or dishonored step\nThat hath deprived me of your grace and favor,\nBut even for want of that for which I am richer:\nA still-soliciting eye and such a tongue\nThat I am glad I have not, though not to have it\nHath lost me in your liking.\n\nLEAR  Better thou\nHadst not been born than not t' have pleased me\nbetter.\n\nFRANCE\nIs it but this--a tardiness in nature\nWhich often leaves the history unspoke\nThat it intends to do?--My lord of Burgundy,\nWhat say you to the lady? Love's not love\nWhen it is mingled with regards that stands\nAloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?\nShe is herself a dowry.\n\nBURGUNDY, [to Lear]  Royal king,\nGive but that portion which yourself proposed,\nAnd here I take Cordelia by the hand,\nDuchess of Burgundy.\n\nLEAR\nNothing. I have sworn. I am firm.\n\nBURGUNDY, [to Cordelia]\nI am sorry, then, you have so lost a father\nThat you must lose a husband.\n\nCORDELIA  Peace be with\nBurgundy.\nSince that respect and fortunes are his love,\nI shall not be his wife.\n\nFRANCE\nFairest Cordelia, that art most rich being poor;\nMost choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised,\nThee and thy virtues here I seize upon,\nBe it lawful I take up what's cast away.\nGods, gods! 'Tis strange that from their cold'st\nneglect\nMy love should kindle to enflamed respect.--\nThy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my\nchance,\nIs queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.\nNot all the dukes of wat'rish Burgundy\nCan buy this unprized precious maid of me.--\nBid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.\nThou losest here a better where to find.\n\nLEAR\nThou hast her, France. Let her be thine, for we\nHave no such daughter, nor shall ever see\nThat face of hers again. [To Cordelia.] Therefore\nbegone\nWithout our grace, our love, our benison.--\nCome, noble Burgundy.\n[Flourish. All but France, Cordelia,\nGoneril, and Regan exit.]\n\nFRANCE  Bid farewell to your sisters.\n\nCORDELIA\nThe jewels of our father, with washed eyes\nCordelia leaves you. I know you what you are,\nAnd like a sister am most loath to call\nYour faults as they are named. Love well our\nfather.\nTo your professed bosoms I commit him;\nBut yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\nI would prefer him to a better place.\nSo farewell to you both.\n\nREGAN\nPrescribe not us our duty.\n\nGONERIL  Let your study\nBe to content your lord, who hath received you\nAt Fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted\nAnd well are worth the want that you have wanted.\n\nCORDELIA\nTime shall unfold what plighted cunning hides,\nWho covers faults at last with shame derides.\nWell may you prosper.\n\nFRANCE  Come, my fair Cordelia.\n[France and Cordelia exit.]\n\nGONERIL  Sister, it is not little I have to say of what\nmost nearly appertains to us both. I think our\nfather will hence tonight.\n\nREGAN  That's most certain, and with you; next month\nwith us.\n\nGONERIL  You see how full of changes his age is; the\nobservation we have made of it hath not been\nlittle. He always loved our sister most, and with\nwhat poor judgment he hath now cast her off\nappears too grossly.\n\nREGAN  'Tis the infirmity of his age. Yet he hath ever\nbut slenderly known himself.\n\nGONERIL  The best and soundest of his time hath been\nbut rash. Then must we look from his age to\nreceive not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed\ncondition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness\nthat infirm and choleric years bring with\nthem.\n\nREGAN  Such unconstant starts are we like to have\nfrom him as this of Kent's banishment.\n\nGONERIL  There is further compliment of leave-taking\nbetween France and him. Pray you, let us sit\ntogether. If our father carry authority with such\ndisposition as he bears, this last surrender of his will\nbut offend us.\n\nREGAN  We shall further think of it.\n\nGONERIL  We must do something, and i' th' heat.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Edmund, the Bastard.]\n\n\nEDMUND\nThou, Nature, art my goddess. To thy law\nMy services are bound. Wherefore should I\nStand in the plague of custom, and permit\nThe curiosity of nations to deprive me\nFor that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\nLag of a brother? why \"bastard\"? Wherefore \"base,\"\nWhen my dimensions are as well compact,\nMy mind as generous and my shape as true\nAs honest madam's issue? Why brand they us\nWith \"base,\" with \"baseness,\" \"bastardy,\" \"base,\"\n\"base,\"\nWho, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\nMore composition and fierce quality\nThan doth within a dull, stale, tired bed\nGo to th' creating a whole tribe of fops\nGot 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,\nLegitimate Edgar, I must have your land.\nOur father's love is to the bastard Edmund\nAs to th' legitimate. Fine word, \"legitimate.\"\nWell, my legitimate, if this letter speed\nAnd my invention thrive, Edmund the base\nShall top th' legitimate. I grow, I prosper.\nNow, gods, stand up for bastards!\n\n[Enter Gloucester.]\n\n\nGLOUCESTER\nKent banished thus? And France in choler parted?\nAnd the King gone tonight, prescribed his power,\nConfined to exhibition? All this done\nUpon the gad?--Edmund, how now? What news?\n\nEDMUND  So please your Lordship, none. [He puts a\npaper in his pocket.]\n\nGLOUCESTER  Why so earnestly seek you to put up that\nletter?\n\nEDMUND  I know no news, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER  What paper were you reading?\n\nEDMUND  Nothing, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER  No? What needed then that terrible dispatch\nof it into your pocket? The quality of nothing\nhath not such need to hide itself. Let's see. Come, if\nit be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.\n\nEDMUND  I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter\nfrom my brother that I have not all o'erread; and\nfor so much as I have perused, I find it not fit for\nyour o'erlooking.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Give me the letter, sir.\n\nEDMUND  I shall offend either to detain or give it. The\ncontents, as in part I understand them, are to\nblame.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Let's see, let's see.\n[Edmund gives him the paper.]\n\nEDMUND  I hope, for my brother's justification, he\nwrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.\n\nGLOUCESTER [(reads)]  This policy and reverence of age\nmakes the world bitter to the best of our times, keeps\nour fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish\nthem. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the\noppression of aged tyranny, who sways not as it hath\npower but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I\nmay speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked\nhim, you should enjoy half his revenue forever and\nlive the beloved of your brother. \tEdgar.\nHum? Conspiracy? \"Sleep till I wake him, you\nshould enjoy half his revenue.\" My son Edgar! Had\nhe a hand to write this? A heart and brain to breed it\nin?--When came you to this? Who brought it?\n\nEDMUND  It was not brought me, my lord; there's the\ncunning of it. I found it thrown in at the casement\nof my closet.\n\nGLOUCESTER  You know the character to be your\nbrother's?\n\nEDMUND  If the matter were good, my lord, I durst\nswear it were his; but in respect of that, I would\nfain think it were not.\n\nGLOUCESTER  It is his.\n\nEDMUND  It is his hand, my lord, but I hope his heart is\nnot in the contents.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Has he never before sounded you in this\nbusiness?\n\nEDMUND  Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft\nmaintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age and\nfathers declined, the father should be as ward to the\nson, and the son manage his revenue.\n\nGLOUCESTER  O villain, villain! His very opinion in the\nletter. Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish\nvillain! Worse than brutish!--Go, sirrah, seek\nhim. I'll apprehend him.--Abominable villain!--\nWhere is he?\n\nEDMUND  I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please\nyou to suspend your indignation against my brother\ntill you can derive from him better testimony of his\nintent, you should run a certain course; where, if\nyou violently proceed against him, mistaking his\npurpose, it would make a great gap in your own\nhonor and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience.\nI dare pawn down my life for him that he hath\nwrit this to feel my affection to your Honor, and to\nno other pretense of danger.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Think you so?\n\nEDMUND  If your Honor judge it meet, I will place you\nwhere you shall hear us confer of this, and by an\nauricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that\nwithout any further delay than this very evening.\n\nGLOUCESTER  He cannot be such a monster.\n\nEDMUND  Nor is not, sure.\n\nGLOUCESTER  To his father, that so tenderly and entirely\nloves him! Heaven and Earth! Edmund, seek him\nout; wind me into him, I pray you. Frame the\nbusiness after your own wisdom. I would unstate\nmyself to be in a due resolution.\n\nEDMUND  I will seek him, sir, presently, convey the\nbusiness as I shall find means, and acquaint you\nwithal.\n\nGLOUCESTER  These late eclipses in the sun and moon\nportend no good to us. Though the wisdom of\nnature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds\nitself scourged by the sequent effects. Love cools,\nfriendship falls off, brothers divide; in cities, mutinies;\nin countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and\nthe bond cracked 'twixt son and father. This villain\nof mine comes under the prediction: there's son\nagainst father. The King falls from bias of nature:\nthere's father against child. We have seen the best of\nour time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and\nall ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our\ngraves.--Find out this villain, Edmund. It shall\nlose thee nothing. Do it carefully.--And the noble\nand true-hearted Kent banished! His offense, honesty!\n'Tis strange.\t[He exits.]\n\nEDMUND  This is the excellent foppery of the world, that\nwhen we are sick in fortune (often the surfeits of\nour own behavior) we make guilty of our disasters\nthe sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains\non necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves,\nthieves, and treachers by spherical predominance;\ndrunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced\nobedience of planetary influence; and all that we\nare evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable\nevasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish\ndisposition on the charge of a star! My father\ncompounded with my mother under the Dragon's\ntail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it\nfollows I am rough and lecherous. Fut, I should\nhave been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the\nfirmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--\n\n[Enter Edgar.]\n\nand pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old\ncomedy. My cue is villainous melancholy, with a\nsigh like Tom o' Bedlam.--O, these eclipses do\nportend these divisions. Fa, sol, la, mi.\n\nEDGAR  How now, brother Edmund, what serious contemplation\nare you in?\n\nEDMUND  I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read\nthis other day, what should follow these eclipses.\n\nEDGAR  Do you busy yourself with that?\n\nEDMUND  I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed\nunhappily, as of unnaturalness between the\nchild and the parent, death, dearth, dissolutions of\nancient amities, divisions in state, menaces and\nmaledictions against king and nobles, needless diffidences,\nbanishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,\nnuptial breaches, and I know not what.\n\nEDGAR  How long have you been a sectary\nastronomical?\n\nEDMUND  Come, come, when saw you my father last?\n\nEDGAR  The night gone by.\n\nEDMUND  Spake you with him?\n\nEDGAR  Ay, two hours together.\n\nEDMUND  Parted you in good terms? Found you no\ndispleasure in him by word nor countenance?\n\nEDGAR  None at all.\n\nEDMUND  Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended\nhim, and at my entreaty forbear his presence\nuntil some little time hath qualified the heat\nof his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in\nhim that with the mischief of your person it would\nscarcely allay.\n\nEDGAR  Some villain hath done me wrong.\n\nEDMUND  That's my fear. I pray you have a continent\nforbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower;\nand, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from\nwhence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak.\nPray you go. There's my key. If you do stir abroad,\ngo armed.\n\nEDGAR  Armed, brother?\n\nEDMUND  Brother, I advise you to the best. I am no\nhonest man if there be any good meaning toward\nyou. I have told you what I have seen and heard, but\nfaintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. Pray\nyou, away.\n\nEDGAR  Shall I hear from you anon?\n\nEDMUND  I do serve you in this business.\t[Edgar exits.]\nA credulous father and a brother noble,\nWhose nature is so far from doing harms\nThat he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\nMy practices ride easy. I see the business.\nLet me, if not by birth, have lands by wit.\nAll with me's meet that I can fashion fit.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Goneril and Oswald, her Steward.]\n\n\nGONERIL  Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding\nof his Fool?\n\nOSWALD  Ay, madam.\n\nGONERIL\nBy day and night he wrongs me. Every hour\nHe flashes into one gross crime or other\nThat sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.\nHis knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us\nOn every trifle. When he returns from hunting,\nI will not speak with him. Say I am sick.\nIf you come slack of former services,\nYou shall do well. The fault of it I'll answer.\n\nOSWALD  He's coming, madam. I hear him.\n\nGONERIL\nPut on what weary negligence you please,\nYou and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.\nIf he distaste it, let him to my sister,\nWhose mind and mine I know in that are one,\nNot to be overruled. Idle old man\nThat still would manage those authorities\nThat he hath given away. Now, by my life,\nOld fools are babes again and must be used\nWith checks as flatteries, when they are seen\nabused.\nRemember what I have said.\n\nOSWALD  Well, madam.\n\nGONERIL\nAnd let his knights have colder looks among you.\nWhat grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.\nI would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,\nThat I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister\nTo hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.\n[They exit in different directions.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Kent in disguise.]\n\n\nKENT\nIf but as well I other accents borrow\nThat can my speech diffuse, my good intent\nMay carry through itself to that full issue\nFor which I razed my likeness. Now, banished Kent,\nIf thou canst serve where thou dost stand\ncondemned,\nSo may it come thy master, whom thou lov'st,\nShall find thee full of labors.\n\n[Horns within. Enter Lear, Knights, and Attendants.]\n\n\nLEAR  Let me not stay a jot for dinner. Go get it ready.\n[An Attendant exits.]\nHow now, what art thou?\n\nKENT  A man, sir.\n\nLEAR  What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with\nus?\n\nKENT  I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve\nhim truly that will put me in trust, to love him that\nis honest, to converse with him that is wise and says\nlittle, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot\nchoose, and to eat no fish.\n\nLEAR  What art thou?\n\nKENT  A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the\nKing.\n\nLEAR  If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a\nking, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?\n\nKENT  Service.\n\nLEAR  Who wouldst thou serve?\n\nKENT  You.\n\nLEAR  Dost thou know me, fellow?\n\nKENT  No, sir, but you have that in your countenance\nwhich I would fain call master.\n\nLEAR  What's that?\n\nKENT  Authority.\n\nLEAR  What services canst do?\n\nKENT  I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a\ncurious tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message\nbluntly. That which ordinary men are fit for I\nam qualified in, and the best of me is diligence.\n\nLEAR  How old art thou?\n\nKENT  Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing,\nnor so old to dote on her for anything. I have years\non my back forty-eight.\n\nLEAR  Follow me. Thou shalt serve me--if I like thee\nno worse after dinner. I will not part from thee\nyet.--Dinner, ho, dinner!--Where's my knave, my\nFool? Go you and call my Fool hither.\n[An Attendant exits.]\n\n[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]\n\nYou, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?\n\nOSWALD  So please you--\t[He exits.]\n\nLEAR  What says the fellow there? Call the clotpole\nback. [A Knight exits.] Where's my Fool? Ho! I think\nthe world's asleep.\n\n[Enter Knight again.]\n\nHow now? Where's that mongrel?\n\nKNIGHT  He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.\n\nLEAR  Why came not the slave back to me when I\ncalled him?\n\nKNIGHT  Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner,\nhe would not.\n\nLEAR  He would not?\n\nKNIGHT  My lord, I know not what the matter is, but to\nmy judgment your Highness is not entertained\nwith that ceremonious affection as you were wont.\nThere's a great abatement of kindness appears as\nwell in the general dependents as in the Duke\nhimself also, and your daughter.\n\nLEAR  Ha? Sayst thou so?\n\nKNIGHT  I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be\nmistaken, for my duty cannot be silent when I think\nyour Highness wronged.\n\nLEAR  Thou but remembrest me of mine own conception.\nI have perceived a most faint neglect of late,\nwhich I have rather blamed as mine own jealous\ncuriosity than as a very pretense and purpose of\nunkindness. I will look further into 't. But where's\nmy Fool? I have not seen him this two days.\n\nKNIGHT  Since my young lady's going into France, sir,\nthe Fool hath much pined away.\n\nLEAR  No more of that. I have noted it well.--Go you\nand tell my daughter I would speak with her. [An\nAttendant exits.] Go you call hither my Fool.\n[Another exits.]\n\n[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]\n\nO you, sir, you, come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?\n\nOSWALD  My lady's father.\n\nLEAR  \"My lady's father\"? My lord's knave! You whoreson\ndog, you slave, you cur!\n\nOSWALD  I am none of these, my lord, I beseech your\npardon.\n\nLEAR  Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?\n[Lear strikes him.]\n\nOSWALD  I'll not be strucken, my lord.\n\nKENT, [tripping him]  Nor tripped neither, you base\nfootball player?\n\nLEAR  I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll\nlove thee.\n\nKENT, [to Oswald]  Come, sir, arise. Away. I'll teach you\ndifferences. Away, away. If you will measure your\nlubber's length again, tarry. But away. Go to. Have\nyou wisdom? So.\t[Oswald exits.]\n\nLEAR  Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's\nearnest of thy service.\t[He gives Kent a purse.]\n\n[Enter Fool.]\n\n\nFOOL  Let me hire him too. [To Kent.] Here's my\ncoxcomb.\t[He offers Kent his cap.]\n\nLEAR  How now, my pretty knave, how dost thou?\n\nFOOL, [to Kent]  Sirrah, you were best take my\ncoxcomb.\n\nLEAR  Why, my boy?\n\nFOOL  Why? For taking one's part that's out of favor.\n[To Kent.] Nay, an thou canst not smile as the\nwind sits, thou 'lt catch cold shortly. There, take my\ncoxcomb. Why, this fellow has banished two on 's\ndaughters and did the third a blessing against his\nwill. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my\ncoxcomb.--How now, nuncle? Would I had two\ncoxcombs and two daughters.\n\nLEAR  Why, my boy?\n\nFOOL  If I gave them all my living, I'd keep my coxcombs\nmyself. There's mine. Beg another of thy\ndaughters.\n\nLEAR  Take heed, sirrah--the whip.\n\nFOOL  Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be\nwhipped out, when the Lady Brach may stand by th'\nfire and stink.\n\nLEAR  A pestilent gall to me!\n\nFOOL  Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.\n\nLEAR  Do.\n\nFOOL  Mark it, nuncle:\n\tHave more than thou showest.\n\tSpeak less than thou knowest,\n\tLend less than thou owest,\n\tRide more than thou goest,\n\tLearn more than thou trowest,\n\tSet less than thou throwest;\n\tLeave thy drink and thy whore\n\tAnd keep in-a-door,\n\tAnd thou shalt have more\n\tThan two tens to a score.\n\nKENT  This is nothing, Fool.\n\nFOOL  Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer.\nYou gave me nothing for 't.--Can you make no use\nof nothing, nuncle?\n\nLEAR  Why no, boy. Nothing can be made out of\nnothing.\n\nFOOL, [to Kent]  Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his\nland comes to. He will not believe a Fool.\n\nLEAR  A bitter Fool!\n\nFOOL  Dost know the difference, my boy, between a\nbitter fool and a sweet one?\n\nLEAR  No, lad, teach me.\n\nFOOL\tThat lord that counseled thee\n\t   To give away thy land,\n\tCome place him here by me;\n\t   Do thou for him stand.\n\tThe sweet and bitter fool\n\t   Will presently appear:\n\tThe one in motley here,\n\t   The other found out there.\n\nLEAR  Dost thou call me \"fool,\" boy?\n\nFOOL  All thy other titles thou hast given away. That\nthou wast born with.\n\nKENT  This is not altogether fool, my lord.\n\nFOOL  No, faith, lords and great men will not let me. If\nI had a monopoly out, they would have part on 't.\nAnd ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool\nto myself; they'll be snatching.--Nuncle, give me\nan egg, and I'll give thee two crowns.\n\nLEAR  What two crowns shall they be?\n\nFOOL  Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat\nup the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou\nclovest thy crown i' th' middle and gav'st away\nboth parts, thou bor'st thine ass on thy back o'er\nthe dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown\nwhen thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak\nlike myself in this, let him be whipped that first\nfinds it so. [Sings.]\n\tFools had ne'er less grace in a year,\n\t   For wise men are grown foppish\n\tAnd know not how their wits to wear,\n\t   Their manners are so apish.\n\nLEAR  When were you wont to be so full of songs,\nsirrah?\n\nFOOL  I have used it, nuncle, e'er since thou mad'st thy\ndaughters thy mothers. For when thou gav'st them\nthe rod and put'st down thine own breeches,\n[Sings.]\n\tThen they for sudden joy did weep,\n\t   And I for sorrow sung,\n\tThat such a king should play bo-peep\n\t   And go the fools among.\nPrithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach\nthy Fool to lie. I would fain learn to lie.\n\nLEAR  An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.\n\nFOOL  I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are.\nThey'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou 'lt\nhave me whipped for lying, and sometimes I am\nwhipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any\nkind o' thing than a Fool. And yet I would not be\nthee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides\nand left nothing i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the\nparings.\n\n[Enter Goneril.]\n\n\nLEAR\nHow now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on?\nMethinks you are too much of late i' th' frown.\n\nFOOL  Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no\nneed to care for her frowning. Now thou art an O\nwithout a figure. I am better than thou art now. I\nam a Fool. Thou art nothing. [To Goneril.] Yes,\nforsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids\nme, though you say nothing.\n\tMum, mum,\n\tHe that keeps nor crust nor crumb,\n\tWeary of all, shall want some.\n[He points at Lear.]\nThat's a shelled peascod.\n\nGONERIL\nNot only, sir, this your all-licensed Fool,\nBut other of your insolent retinue\nDo hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth\nIn rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,\nI had thought by making this well known unto you\nTo have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,\nBy what yourself too late have spoke and done,\nThat you protect this course and put it on\nBy your allowance; which if you should, the fault\nWould not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep\nWhich in the tender of a wholesome weal\nMight in their working do you that offense,\nWhich else were shame, that then necessity\nWill call discreet proceeding.\n\nFOOL  For you know, nuncle,\n\tThe hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,\n\tThat it's had it head bit off by it young.\nSo out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\n\nLEAR  Are you our daughter?\n\nGONERIL\nI would you would make use of your good wisdom,\nWhereof I know you are fraught, and put away\nThese dispositions which of late transport you\nFrom what you rightly are.\n\nFOOL  May not an ass know when the cart draws the\nhorse? Whoop, Jug, I love thee!\n\nLEAR\nDoes any here know me? This is not Lear.\nDoes Lear walk thus, speak thus? Where are his\neyes?\nEither his notion weakens, his discernings\nAre lethargied--Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so.\nWho is it that can tell me who I am?\n\nFOOL  Lear's shadow.\n\nLEAR\nI would learn that, for, by the marks of\nsovereignty,\nKnowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded\nI had daughters.\n\nFOOL  Which they will make an obedient father.\n\nLEAR  Your name, fair gentlewoman?\n\nGONERIL\nThis admiration, sir, is much o' th' savor\nOf other your new pranks. I do beseech you\nTo understand my purposes aright.\nAs you are old and reverend, should be wise.\nHere do you keep a hundred knights and squires,\nMen so disordered, so debauched and bold,\nThat this our court, infected with their manners,\nShows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust\nMakes it more like a tavern or a brothel\nThan a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak\nFor instant remedy. Be then desired,\nBy her that else will take the thing she begs,\nA little to disquantity your train,\nAnd the remainders that shall still depend\nTo be such men as may besort your age,\nWhich know themselves and you.\n\nLEAR  Darkness and\ndevils!--\nSaddle my horses. Call my train together.\n[Some exit.]\nDegenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee.\nYet have I left a daughter.\n\nGONERIL\nYou strike my people, and your disordered rabble\nMake servants of their betters.\n\n[Enter Albany.]\n\n\nLEAR\nWoe that too late repents!--O, sir, are you\ncome?\nIs it your will? Speak, sir.--Prepare my horses.\n[Some exit.]\nIngratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,\nMore hideous when thou show'st thee in a child\nThan the sea monster!\n\nALBANY  Pray, sir, be patient.\n\nLEAR, [to Goneril]  Detested kite, thou liest.\nMy train are men of choice and rarest parts,\nThat all particulars of duty know\nAnd in the most exact regard support\nThe worships of their name. O most small fault,\nHow ugly didst thou in Cordelia show,\nWhich, like an engine, wrenched my frame of\nnature\nFrom the fixed place, drew from my heart all love\nAnd added to the gall! O Lear, Lear, Lear!\n[He strikes his head.]\nBeat at this gate that let thy folly in\nAnd thy dear judgment out.

The noble duke my master,\nMy worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.\nBy his authority I will proclaim it\nThat he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,\nBringing the murderous coward to the stake;\nHe that conceals him, death.\n\nEDMUND\nWhen I dissuaded him from his intent\nAnd found him pight to do it, with curst speech\nI threatened to discover him. He replied\n\"Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think\nIf I would stand against thee, would the reposal\nOf any trust, virtue, or worth in thee\nMake thy words faithed? No. What I should\ndeny--\nAs this I would, though thou didst produce\nMy very character--I'd turn it all\nTo thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice.\nAnd thou must make a dullard of the world\nIf they not thought the profits of my death\nWere very pregnant and potential spurs\nTo make thee seek it.\"\n\nGLOUCESTER  O strange and fastened villain!\nWould he deny his letter, said he?\nI never got him.\t[Tucket within.]\nHark, the Duke's trumpets.

I know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that\nbeguiled you in a plain accent was a plain knave,\nwhich for my part I will not be, though I should\nwin your displeasure to entreat me to 't.\n\nCORNWALL, [to Oswald]  What was th' offense you gave\nhim?\n\nOSWALD  I never gave him any.\nIt pleased the King his master very late\nTo strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\nWhen he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,\nTripped me behind; being down, insulted, railed,\nAnd put upon him such a deal of man\nThat worthied him, got praises of the King\nFor him attempting who was self-subdued;\nAnd in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\nDrew on me here again.\n\nKENT  None of these rogues and cowards\nBut Ajax is their fool.\n\nCORNWALL  Fetch forth the stocks.--\nYou stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,\nWe'll teach you.\n\nKENT  Sir, I am too old to learn.\nCall not your stocks for me. I serve the King,\nOn whose employment I was sent to you.\nYou shall do small respect, show too bold\nmalice\nAgainst the grace and person of my master,\nStocking his messenger.\n\nCORNWALL\nFetch forth the stocks.--As I have life and honor,\nThere shall he sit till noon.\n\nREGAN\nTill noon? Till night, my lord, and all night, too.\n\nKENT\nWhy, madam, if I were your father's dog,\nYou should not use me so.\n\nREGAN  Sir, being his knave, I will.\n\nCORNWALL\nThis is a fellow of the selfsame color\nOur sister speaks of.--Come, bring away the stocks.\n[Stocks brought out.]\n\nGLOUCESTER\nLet me beseech your Grace not to do so.\nHis fault is much, and the good king his master\nWill check him for 't. Your purposed low correction\nIs such as basest and contemned'st wretches\nFor pilf'rings and most common trespasses\nAre punished with. The King must take it ill\nThat he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\nShould have him thus restrained.\n\nCORNWALL  I'll answer that.\n\nREGAN\nMy sister may receive it much more worse\nTo have her gentleman abused, assaulted\nFor following her affairs.--Put in his legs.\n[Kent is put in the stocks.]\n\nCORNWALL  Come, my good lord, away.\n[All but Gloucester and Kent exit.]\n\nGLOUCESTER\nI am sorry for thee, friend.

This act persuades me\nThat this remotion of the Duke and her\nIs practice only. Give me my servant forth.\nGo tell the Duke and 's wife I'd speak with them.\nNow, presently, bid them come forth and hear me,\nOr at their chamber door I'll beat the drum\nTill it cry sleep to death.\n\nGLOUCESTER  I would have all well betwixt you.\n[He exits.]\n\nLEAR\nO me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!\n\nFOOL  Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels\nwhen she put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapped\n'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried \"Down,\nwantons, down!\" 'Twas her brother that in pure\nkindness to his horse buttered his hay.\n\n[Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.]\n\n\nLEAR  Good morrow to you both.\n\nCORNWALL  Hail to your Grace.\n[Kent here set at liberty.]\n\nREGAN  I am glad to see your Highness.\n\nLEAR\nRegan, I think you are. I know what reason\nI have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,\nI would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,\nSepulch'ring an adult'ress. [To Kent.] O, are you\nfree?\nSome other time for that.--Beloved Regan,\nThy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied\nSharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here.\nI can scarce speak to thee. Thou 'lt not believe\nWith how depraved a quality--O Regan!\n\nREGAN\nI pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope\nYou less know how to value her desert\nThan she to scant her duty.\n\nLEAR  Say? How is that?\n\nREGAN\nI cannot think my sister in the least\nWould fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\nShe have restrained the riots of your followers,\n'Tis on such ground and to such wholesome end\nAs clears her from all blame.\n\nLEAR  My curses on her.\n\nREGAN  O sir, you are old.\nNature in you stands on the very verge\nOf his confine. You should be ruled and led\nBy some discretion that discerns your state\nBetter than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you\nThat to our sister you do make return.\nSay you have wronged her.\n\nLEAR  Ask her forgiveness?\nDo you but mark how this becomes the house:\n[He kneels.]\n\"Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.\nAge is unnecessary. On my knees I beg\nThat you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.\"\n\nREGAN\nGood sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks.\nReturn you to my sister.\n\nLEAR, [rising]  Never, Regan.\nShe hath abated me of half my train,\nLooked black upon me, struck me with her tongue\nMost serpentlike upon the very heart.\nAll the stored vengeances of heaven fall\nOn her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,\nYou taking airs, with lameness!\n\nCORNWALL  Fie, sir, fie!\n\nLEAR\nYou nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames\nInto her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,\nYou fen-sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun\nTo fall and blister!\n\nREGAN\nO, the blest gods! So will you wish on me\nWhen the rash mood is on.\n\nLEAR\nNo, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.\nThy tender-hefted nature shall not give\nThee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce, but\nthine\nDo comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee\nTo grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,\nTo bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,\nAnd, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt\nAgainst my coming in. Thou better know'st\nThe offices of nature, bond of childhood,\nEffects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.\nThy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,\nWherein I thee endowed.\n\nREGAN  Good sir, to th' purpose.\n[Tucket within.]\n\nLEAR\nWho put my man i' th' stocks?\n\nCORNWALL  What trumpet's that?\n\nREGAN\nI know 't--my sister's. This approves her letter,\nThat she would soon be here.\n\n[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]\n\nIs your lady come?\n\nLEAR\nThis is a slave whose easy-borrowed pride\nDwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.--\nOut, varlet, from my sight!\n\nCORNWALL  What means your Grace?\n\nLEAR\nWho stocked my servant? Regan, I have good hope\nThou didst not know on 't.\n\n[Enter Goneril.]\n\nWho comes here? O heavens,\nIf you do love old men, if your sweet sway\nAllow obedience, if you yourselves are old,\nMake it your cause. Send down and take my part.\n[To Goneril.] Art not ashamed to look upon this\nbeard?\t[Regan takes Goneril's hand.]\nO Regan, will you take her by the hand?\n\nGONERIL\nWhy not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?\nAll's not offense that indiscretion finds\nAnd dotage terms so.\n\nLEAR  O sides, you are too tough!\nWill you yet hold?--How came my man i' th'\nstocks?\n\nCORNWALL\nI set him there, sir, but his own disorders\nDeserved much less advancement.\n\nLEAR  You? Did you?\n\nREGAN\nI pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\nIf till the expiration of your month\nYou will return and sojourn with my sister,\nDismissing half your train, come then to me.\nI am now from home and out of that provision\nWhich shall be needful for your entertainment.\n\nLEAR\nReturn to her? And fifty men dismissed?\nNo! Rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\nTo wage against the enmity o' th' air,\nTo be a comrade with the wolf and owl,\nNecessity's sharp pinch. Return with her?\nWhy the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\nOur youngest born--I could as well be brought\nTo knee his throne and, squire-like, pension beg\nTo keep base life afoot. Return with her?\nPersuade me rather to be slave and sumpter\nTo this detested groom.\t[He indicates Oswald.]\n\nGONERIL  At your choice, sir.\n\nLEAR\nI prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.\nI will not trouble thee, my child. Farewell.\nWe'll no more meet, no more see one another.\nBut yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter,\nOr, rather, a disease that's in my flesh,\nWhich I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,\nA plague-sore or embossed carbuncle\nIn my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.\nLet shame come when it will; I do not call it.\nI do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,\nNor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.\nMend when thou canst. Be better at thy leisure.\nI can be patient. I can stay with Regan,\nI and my hundred knights.\n\nREGAN  Not altogether so.\nI looked not for you yet, nor am provided\nFor your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister,\nFor those that mingle reason with your passion\nMust be content to think you old, and so--\nBut she knows what she does.\n\nLEAR  Is this well spoken?\n\nREGAN\nI dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?\nIs it not well? What should you need of more?\nYea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\nSpeak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house\nShould many people under two commands\nHold amity? 'Tis hard, almost impossible.\n\nGONERIL\nWhy might not you, my lord, receive attendance\nFrom those that she calls servants, or from mine?\n\nREGAN\nWhy not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack\nyou,\nWe could control them. If you will come to me\n(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you\nTo bring but five-and-twenty. To no more\nWill I give place or notice.\n\nLEAR  I gave you all--\n\nREGAN  And in good time you gave it.\n\nLEAR\nMade you my guardians, my depositaries,\nBut kept a reservation to be followed\nWith such a number. What, must I come to you\nWith five-and-twenty? Regan, said you so?\n\nREGAN\nAnd speak 't again, my lord. No more with me.\n\nLEAR\nThose wicked creatures yet do look well-favored\nWhen others are more wicked. Not being the worst\nStands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril.] I'll go\nwith thee.\nThy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,\nAnd thou art twice her love.\n\nGONERIL  Hear me, my lord.\nWhat need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,\nTo follow in a house where twice so many\nHave a command to tend you?\n\nREGAN  What need one?\n\nLEAR\nO, reason not the need! Our basest beggars\nAre in the poorest thing superfluous.\nAllow not nature more than nature needs,\nMan's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady;\nIf only to go warm were gorgeous,\nWhy, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,\nWhich scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true\nneed--\nYou heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!\nYou see me here, you gods, a poor old man\nAs full of grief as age, wretched in both.\nIf it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts\nAgainst their father, fool me not so much\nTo bear it tamely. Touch me with noble anger,\nAnd let not women's weapons, water drops,\nStain my man's cheeks.--No, you unnatural hags,\nI will have such revenges on you both\nThat all the world shall--I will do such things--\nWhat they are yet I know not, but they shall be\nThe terrors of the Earth! You think I'll weep.\nNo, I'll not weep.\nI have full cause of weeping, but this heart\n[Storm and tempest.]\nShall break into a hundred thousand flaws\nOr ere I'll weep.--O Fool, I shall go mad!\n[Lear, Kent, and Fool exit\nwith Gloucester and the Gentleman.]\n\nCORNWALL  Let us withdraw. 'Twill be a storm.\n\nREGAN\nThis house is little. The old man and 's people\nCannot be well bestowed.\n\nGONERIL\n'Tis his own blame hath put himself from rest,\nAnd must needs taste his folly.\n\nREGAN\nFor his particular, I'll receive him gladly,\nBut not one follower.\n\nGONERIL\nSo am I purposed. Where is my lord of Gloucester?\n\nCORNWALL\nFollowed the old man forth.\n\n[Enter Gloucester.]\n\nHe is returned.\n\nGLOUCESTER  The King is in high rage.\n\nCORNWALL  Whither is he going?\n\nGLOUCESTER\nHe calls to horse, but will I know not whither.\n\nCORNWALL\n'Tis best to give him way. He leads himself.\n\nGONERIL, [to Gloucester]\nMy lord, entreat him by no means to stay.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nAlack, the night comes on, and the high winds\nDo sorely ruffle. For many miles about\nThere's scarce a bush.\n\nREGAN  O sir, to willful men\nThe injuries that they themselves procure\nMust be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.\nHe is attended with a desperate train,\nAnd what they may incense him to, being apt\nTo have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.\n\nCORNWALL\nShut up your doors, my lord. 'Tis a wild night.\nMy Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 3\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Storm still. Enter Kent in disguise, and a Gentleman,\nseverally.]\n\n\nKENT  Who's there, besides foul weather?\n\nGENTLEMAN\nOne minded like the weather, most unquietly.\n\nKENT  I know you. Where's the King?\n\nGENTLEMAN\nContending with the fretful elements;\nBids the wind blow the earth into the sea\nOr swell the curled waters 'bove the main,\nThat things might change or cease; tears his white\nhair,\nWhich the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage\nCatch in their fury and make nothing of;\nStrives in his little world of man to outscorn\nThe to-and-fro conflicting wind and rain.\nThis night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would\ncouch,\nThe lion and the belly-pinched wolf\nKeep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs\nAnd bids what will take all.\n\nKENT  But who is with him?\n\nGENTLEMAN\nNone but the Fool, who labors to outjest\nHis heart-struck injuries.\n\nKENT  Sir, I do know you\nAnd dare upon the warrant of my note\nCommend a dear thing to you. There is division,\nAlthough as yet the face of it is covered\nWith mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall,\nWho have--as who have not, that their great stars\nThroned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,\nWhich are to France the spies and speculations\nIntelligent of our state. From France there comes\na power\nInto this scattered kingdom, who already,\nWise in our negligence, have secret feet\nIn some of our best ports and are at point\nTo show their open banner. Now to you:\nIf on my credit you dare build so far\nTo make your speed to Dover, you shall find\nSome that will thank you, making just report\nOf how unnatural and bemadding sorrow\nThe King hath cause to plain: what hath been seen,\nEither in snuffs and packings of the dukes,\nOr the hard rein which both of them hath borne\nAgainst the old kind king, or something deeper,\nWhereof perchance these are but furnishings.\nI am a gentleman of blood and breeding,\nAnd from some knowledge and assurance offer\nThis office to you.\n\nGENTLEMAN\nI will talk further with you.\n\nKENT  No, do not.\nFor confirmation that I am much more\nThan my outwall, open this purse and take\nWhat it contains.\n[Kent hands him a purse and a ring.]\nIf you shall see Cordelia\n(As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,\nAnd she will tell you who that fellow is\nThat yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!\nI will go seek the King.\n\nGENTLEMAN\nGive me your hand. Have you no more to say?\n\nKENT\nFew words, but, to effect, more than all yet:\nThat when we have found the King--in which your\npain\nThat way, I'll this--he that first lights on him\nHolla the other.\n[They exit separately.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool.]\n\n\nLEAR\nBlow winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!\nYou cataracts and hurricanoes, spout\nTill you have drenched our steeples, drowned the\ncocks.\nYou sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,\nVaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,\nSinge my white head. And thou, all-shaking\nthunder,\nStrike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world.\nCrack nature's molds, all germens spill at once\nThat makes ingrateful man.\n\nFOOL  O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is\nbetter than this rainwater out o' door. Good nuncle,\nin. Ask thy daughters' blessing. Here's a night\npities neither wise men nor fools.\n\nLEAR\nRumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!\nNor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.\nI tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.\nI never gave you kingdom, called you children;\nYou owe me no subscription. Then let fall\nYour horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,\nA poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man.\nBut yet I call you servile ministers,\nThat will with two pernicious daughters join\nYour high-engendered battles 'gainst a head\nSo old and white as this. O, ho, 'tis foul!\n\nFOOL  He that has a house to put 's head in has a good\nheadpiece.\n\tThe codpiece that will house\n\t   Before the head has any,\n\tThe head and he shall louse;\n\t   So beggars marry many.\n\tThe man that makes his toe\n\t   What he his heart should make,\n\tShall of a corn cry woe,\n\t   And turn his sleep to wake.\nFor there was never yet fair woman but she made\nmouths in a glass.\n\nLEAR\nNo, I will be the pattern of all patience.\nI will say nothing.\n\n[Enter Kent in disguise.]\n\n\nKENT  Who's there?\n\nFOOL  Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a\nwise man and a fool.\n\nKENT\nAlas, sir, are you here? Things that love night\nLove not such nights as these. The wrathful skies\nGallow the very wanderers of the dark\nAnd make them keep their caves. Since I was man,\nSuch sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,\nSuch groans of roaring wind and rain I never\nRemember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry\nTh' affliction nor the fear.\n\nLEAR  Let the great gods\nThat keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads\nFind out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,\nThat hast within thee undivulged crimes\nUnwhipped of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand,\nThou perjured, and thou simular of virtue\nThat art incestuous. Caitiff, to pieces shake,\nThat under covert and convenient seeming\nHas practiced on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,\nRive your concealing continents and cry\nThese dreadful summoners grace. I am a man\nMore sinned against than sinning.\n\nKENT  Alack,\nbareheaded?\nGracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel.\nSome friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.\nRepose you there while I to this hard house--\nMore harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised,\nWhich even but now, demanding after you,\nDenied me to come in--return and force\nTheir scanted courtesy.\n\nLEAR  My wits begin to turn.--\nCome on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?\nI am cold myself.--Where is this straw, my fellow?\nThe art of our necessities is strange\nAnd can make vile things precious. Come, your\nhovel.--\nPoor Fool and knave, I have one part in my heart\nThat's sorry yet for thee.\n\nFOOL [sings]\n\tHe that has and a little tiny wit,\n\t   With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,\n\tMust make content with his fortunes fit,\n\t   Though the rain it raineth every day.\n\nLEAR\nTrue, my good boy.--Come, bring us to this hovel.\n[Lear and Kent exit.]\n\nFOOL  This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll\nspeak a prophecy ere I go:\n\tWhen priests are more in word than matter,\n\tWhen brewers mar their malt with water,\n\tWhen nobles are their tailors' tutors,\n\tNo heretics burned but wenches' suitors,\n\tWhen every case in law is right,\n\tNo squire in debt, nor no poor knight;\n\tWhen slanders do not live in tongues,\n\tNor cutpurses come not to throngs,\n\tWhen usurers tell their gold i' th' field,\n\tAnd bawds and whores do churches build,\n\tThen shall the realm of Albion\n\tCome to great confusion;\n\tThen comes the time, who lives to see 't,\n\tThat going shall be used with feet.\nThis prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before\nhis time.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Gloucester and Edmund.]\n\n\nGLOUCESTER  Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this\nunnatural dealing. When I desired their leave that I\nmight pity him, they took from me the use of mine\nown house, charged me on pain of perpetual\ndispleasure neither to speak of him, entreat for\nhim, or any way sustain him.\n\nEDMUND  Most savage and unnatural.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Go to; say you nothing. There is division\nbetween the dukes, and a worse matter than that. I\nhave received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to\nbe spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet.\nThese injuries the King now bears will be revenged\nhome; there is part of a power already footed. We\nmust incline to the King. I will look him and privily\nrelieve him. Go you and maintain talk with the\nDuke, that my charity be not of him perceived. If he\nask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. If I die for it, as\nno less is threatened me, the King my old master\nmust be relieved. There is strange things toward,\nEdmund. Pray you, be careful.\t[He exits.]\n\nEDMUND\nThis courtesy forbid thee shall the Duke\nInstantly know, and of that letter too.\nThis seems a fair deserving, and must draw me\nThat which my father loses--no less than all.\nThe younger rises when the old doth fall.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Lear, Kent in disguise, and Fool.]\n\n\nKENT\nHere is the place, my lord.

Good my lord, enter.\n\nLEAR\nThou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm\nInvades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee.\nBut where the greater malady is fixed,\nThe lesser is scarce felt. Thou 'dst shun a bear,\nBut if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea,\nThou 'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the\nmind's free,\nThe body's delicate. This tempest in my mind\nDoth from my senses take all feeling else\nSave what beats there. Filial ingratitude!\nIs it not as this mouth should tear this hand\nFor lifting food to 't? But I will punish home.\nNo, I will weep no more. In such a night\nTo shut me out? Pour on. I will endure.\nIn such a night as this? O Regan, Goneril,\nYour old kind father whose frank heart gave all!\nO, that way madness lies. Let me shun that;\nNo more of that.\n\nKENT  Good my lord, enter here.\n\nLEAR\nPrithee, go in thyself. Seek thine own ease.\nThis tempest will not give me leave to ponder\nOn things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.--\nIn, boy; go first.--You houseless poverty--\nNay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.\n[Fool exits.]\nPoor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,\nThat bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,\nHow shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,\nYour looped and windowed raggedness defend\nyou\nFrom seasons such as these?

Come forth.\n\n[Enter Edgar in disguise.]\n\n\nEDGAR  Away. The foul fiend follows me. Through the\nsharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. Hum! Go to\nthy cold bed and warm thee.\n\nLEAR  Didst thou give all to thy daughters? And art thou\ncome to this?\n\nEDGAR  Who gives anything to Poor Tom, whom the\nfoul fiend hath led through fire and through flame,\nthrough ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire;\nthat hath laid knives under his pillow and\nhalters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge,\nmade him proud of heart to ride on a bay trotting\nhorse over four-inched bridges to course his own\nshadow for a traitor? Bless thy five wits! Tom's\na-cold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from\nwhirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do Poor Tom\nsome charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. There\ncould I have him now, and there--and there again\n--and there.\t[Storm still.]\n\nLEAR\nHas his daughters brought him to this pass?--\nCouldst thou save nothing?

Nothing could have subdued nature\nTo such a lowness but his unkind daughters.\nIs it the fashion that discarded fathers\nShould have thus little mercy on their flesh?\nJudicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot\nThose pelican daughters.\n\nEDGAR  Pillicock sat on Pillicock Hill. Alow, alow, loo,\nloo.\n\nFOOL  This cold night will turn us all to fools and\nmadmen.\n\nEDGAR  Take heed o' th' foul fiend. Obey thy parents,\nkeep thy word's justice, swear not, commit not with\nman's sworn spouse, set not thy sweet heart on\nproud array. Tom's a-cold.\n\nLEAR  What hast thou been?\n\nEDGAR  A servingman, proud in heart and mind, that\ncurled my hair, wore gloves in my cap, served the\nlust of my mistress' heart and did the act of\ndarkness with her, swore as many oaths as I spake\nwords and broke them in the sweet face of heaven;\none that slept in the contriving of lust and waked to\ndo it. Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in\nwoman out-paramoured the Turk. False of heart,\nlight of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in\nstealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in\nprey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling\nof silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy\nfoot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy\npen from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.\nStill through the hawthorn blows the cold wind;\nsays suum, mun, nonny.

He begins\nat curfew and walks till the first cock. He\ngives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and\nmakes the harelip, mildews the white wheat, and\nhurts the poor creature of earth.\n\tSwithold footed thrice the 'old,\n\tHe met the nightmare and her ninefold,\n\t   Bid her alight,\n\t   And her troth plight,\n\tAnd aroint thee, witch, aroint thee.\n\nKENT  How fares your Grace?\n\nLEAR  What's he?\n\nKENT  Who's there? What is 't you seek?\n\nGLOUCESTER  What are you there? Your names?\n\nEDGAR  Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the\ntoad, the tadpole, the wall newt, and the water;\nthat, in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend\nrages, eats cow dung for sallets, swallows the old\nrat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of\nthe standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to\ntithing, and stocked, punished, and imprisoned;\nwho hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to\nhis body,\n\tHorse to ride, and weapon to wear;\n\tBut mice and rats and such small deer\n\tHave been Tom's food for seven long year.\nBeware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! Peace, thou\nfiend!\n\nGLOUCESTER, [to Lear]\nWhat, hath your Grace no better company?\n\nEDGAR  The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman. Modo\nhe's called, and Mahu.\n\nGLOUCESTER, [to Lear]\nOur flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile\nThat it doth hate what gets it.\n\nEDGAR  Poor Tom's a-cold.\n\nGLOUCESTER, [to Lear]\nGo in with me. My duty cannot suffer\nT' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.\nThough their injunction be to bar my doors\nAnd let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,\nYet have I ventured to come seek you out\nAnd bring you where both fire and food is ready.\n\nLEAR\nFirst let me talk with this philosopher.\n[To Edgar.] What is the cause of thunder?\n\nKENT\nGood my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.\n\nLEAR\nI'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.--\nWhat is your study?\n\nEDGAR  How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.\n\nLEAR  Let me ask you one word in private.\n[They talk aside.]\n\nKENT, [to Gloucester]\nImportune him once more to go, my lord.\nHis wits begin t' unsettle.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Canst thou blame him?\n[Storm still.]\nHis daughters seek his death.

Seek, seek for him,\nLest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life\nThat wants the means to lead it.\n\n[Enter Messenger.]\n\n\nMESSENGER  News, madam.\nThe British powers are marching hitherward.\n\nCORDELIA\n'Tis known before. Our preparation stands\nIn expectation of them.--O dear father,\nIt is thy business that I go about.\nTherefore great France\nMy mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.\nNo blown ambition doth our arms incite,\nBut love, dear love, and our aged father's right.\nSoon may I hear and see him.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n[Enter Regan and Oswald, the Steward.]\n\n\nREGAN\nBut are my brother's powers set forth?\n\nOSWALD  Ay, madam.\n\nREGAN  Himself in person there?\n\nOSWALD  Madam, with much ado.\nYour sister is the better soldier.\n\nREGAN\nLord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?\n\nOSWALD  No, madam.\n\nREGAN\nWhat might import my sister's letter to him?\n\nOSWALD  I know not, lady.\n\nREGAN\nFaith, he is posted hence on serious matter.\nIt was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,\nTo let him live. Where he arrives he moves\nAll hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,\nIn pity of his misery, to dispatch\nHis nighted life; moreover to descry\nThe strength o' th' enemy.\n\nOSWALD\nI must needs after him, madam, with my letter.\n\nREGAN\nOur troops set forth tomorrow. Stay with us.\nThe ways are dangerous.\n\nOSWALD  I may not, madam.\nMy lady charged my duty in this business.\n\nREGAN\nWhy should she write to Edmund? Might not you\nTransport her purposes by word? Belike,\nSome things--I know not what. I'll love thee much--\nLet me unseal the letter.\n\nOSWALD  Madam, I had rather--\n\nREGAN\nI know your lady does not love her husband;\nI am sure of that; and at her late being here,\nShe gave strange eliads and most speaking looks\nTo noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\n\nOSWALD  I, madam?\n\nREGAN\nI speak in understanding. Y' are; I know 't.\nTherefore I do advise you take this note:\nMy lord is dead; Edmund and I have talked,\nAnd more convenient is he for my hand\nThan for your lady's. You may gather more.\nIf you do find him, pray you, give him this,\nAnd when your mistress hears thus much from you,\nI pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.\nSo, fare you well.\nIf you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\nPreferment falls on him that cuts him off.\n\nOSWALD\nWould I could meet him, madam. I should show\nWhat party I do follow.\n\nREGAN  Fare thee well.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 6\n=======\n[Enter Gloucester and Edgar dressed as a peasant.]\n\n\nGLOUCESTER\nWhen shall I come to th' top of that same hill?\n\nEDGAR\nYou do climb up it now. Look how we labor.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nMethinks the ground is even.\n\nEDGAR  Horrible steep.\nHark, do you hear the sea?\n\nGLOUCESTER  No, truly.\n\nEDGAR\nWhy then, your other senses grow imperfect\nBy your eyes' anguish.\n\nGLOUCESTER  So may it be indeed.\nMethinks thy voice is altered and thou speak'st\nIn better phrase and matter than thou didst.\n\nEDGAR\nYou're much deceived; in nothing am I changed\nBut in my garments.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Methinks you're better spoken.\n\nEDGAR\nCome on, sir. Here's the place. Stand still. How\nfearful\nAnd dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!\nThe crows and choughs that wing the midway air\nShow scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down\nHangs one that gathers samphire--dreadful trade;\nMethinks he seems no bigger than his head.\nThe fishermen that walk upon the beach\nAppear like mice, and yond tall anchoring bark\nDiminished to her cock, her cock a buoy\nAlmost too small for sight. The murmuring surge\nThat on th' unnumbered idle pebble chafes\nCannot be heard so high. I'll look no more\nLest my brain turn and the deficient sight\nTopple down headlong.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Set me where you stand.\n\nEDGAR\nGive me your hand. You are now within a foot\nOf th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon\nWould I not leap upright.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Let go my hand.\nHere, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel\nWell worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods\nProsper it with thee.\t[He gives Edgar a purse.]\nGo thou further off.\nBid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.\n\nEDGAR, [walking away]\nNow fare you well, good sir.\n\nGLOUCESTER  With all my heart.\n\nEDGAR, [aside]\nWhy I do trifle thus with his despair\nIs done to cure it.\n\nGLOUCESTER  O you mighty gods!\t[He kneels.]\nThis world I do renounce, and in your sights\nShake patiently my great affliction off.\nIf I could bear it longer, and not fall\nTo quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\nMy snuff and loathed part of nature should\nBurn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!--\nNow, fellow, fare thee well.\t[He falls.]\n\nEDGAR  Gone, sir. Farewell.--\nAnd yet I know not how conceit may rob\nThe treasury of life, when life itself\nYields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,\nBy this had thought been past. Alive or dead?--\nHo you, sir! Friend, hear you. Sir, speak.--\nThus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives.--\nWhat are you, sir?\n\nGLOUCESTER  Away, and let me die.\n\nEDGAR\nHadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\nSo many fathom down precipitating,\nThou 'dst shivered like an egg; but thou dost\nbreathe,\nHast heavy substance, bleed'st not, speak'st, art\nsound.\nTen masts at each make not the altitude\nWhich thou hast perpendicularly fell.\nThy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.\n\nGLOUCESTER  But have I fall'n or no?\n\nEDGAR\nFrom the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\nLook up a-height. The shrill-gorged lark so far\nCannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Alack, I have no eyes.\nIs wretchedness deprived that benefit\nTo end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort\nWhen misery could beguile the tyrant's rage\nAnd frustrate his proud will.\n\nEDGAR  Give me your arm.\n[He raises Gloucester.]\nUp. So, how is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nToo well, too well.\n\nEDGAR  This is above all strangeness.\nUpon the crown o' th' cliff, what thing was that\nWhich parted from you?\n\nGLOUCESTER  A poor unfortunate beggar.\n\nEDGAR\nAs I stood here below, methought his eyes\nWere two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\nHorns whelked and waved like the enraged sea.\nIt was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\nThink that the clearest gods, who make them\nhonors\nOf men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nI do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear\nAffliction till it do cry out itself\n\"Enough, enough!\" and die. That thing you speak of,\nI took it for a man. Often 'twould say\n\"The fiend, the fiend!\" He led me to that place.\n\nEDGAR\nBear free and patient thoughts.\n\n[Enter Lear.]\n\nBut who comes here?\nThe safer sense will ne'er accommodate\nHis master thus.\n\nLEAR  No, they cannot touch me for coining. I am the\nKing himself.\n\nEDGAR  O, thou side-piercing sight!\n\nLEAR  Nature's above art in that respect. There's your\npress-money. That fellow handles his bow like a\ncrowkeeper. Draw me a clothier's yard. Look, look,\na mouse! Peace, peace! This piece of toasted cheese\nwill do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a\ngiant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!\nI' th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.\n\nEDGAR  Sweet marjoram.\n\nLEAR  Pass.\n\nGLOUCESTER  I know that voice.\n\nLEAR  Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flattered\nme like a dog and told me I had the white hairs in\nmy beard ere the black ones were there. To say \"ay\"\nand \"no\" to everything that I said \"ay\" and \"no\" to\nwas no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me\nonce and the wind to make me chatter, when the\nthunder would not peace at my bidding, there I\nfound 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to. They are\nnot men o' their words; they told me I was everything.\n'Tis a lie. I am not ague-proof.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nThe trick of that voice I do well remember.\nIs 't not the King?\n\nLEAR  Ay, every inch a king.\nWhen I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\nI pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?\nAdultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.\nThe wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly does\nlecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive, for\nGloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father\nthan my daughters got 'tween the lawful sheets. To\n't, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers. Behold yond\nsimp'ring dame, whose face between her forks\npresages snow, that minces virtue and does shake\nthe head to hear of pleasure's name. The fitchew\nnor the soiled horse goes to 't with a more riotous\nappetite. Down from the waist they are centaurs,\nthough women all above. But to the girdle do the\ngods inherit; beneath is all the fiend's. There's hell,\nthere's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit; burning,\nscalding, stench, consumption! Fie, fie, fie, pah,\npah! Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary;\nsweeten my imagination. There's money for thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER  O, let me kiss that hand!\n\nLEAR  Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nO ruined piece of nature! This great world\nShall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?\n\nLEAR  I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou\nsquinny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, I'll\nnot love. Read thou this challenge. Mark but the\npenning of it.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nWere all thy letters suns, I could not see.\n\nEDGAR, [aside]\nI would not take this from report. It is,\nAnd my heart breaks at it.\n\nLEAR  Read.\n\nGLOUCESTER  What, with the case of eyes?\n\nLEAR  O ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your\nhead, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in\na heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how\nthis world goes.\n\nGLOUCESTER  I see it feelingly.\n\nLEAR  What, art mad? A man may see how this world\ngoes with no eyes. Look with thine ears. See how\nyond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in\nthine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy, which\nis the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a\nfarmer's dog bark at a beggar?\n\nGLOUCESTER  Ay, sir.\n\nLEAR  And the creature run from the cur? There thou\nmight'st behold the great image of authority: a\ndog's obeyed in office.\nThou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\nWhy dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back.\nThou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\nFor which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the\ncozener.\nThrough tattered clothes small vices do appear.\nRobes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with\ngold,\nAnd the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.\nArm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.\nNone does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em.\nTake that of me, my friend, who have the power\nTo seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes,\nAnd like a scurvy politician\nSeem to see the things thou dost not. Now, now,\nnow, now.\nPull off my boots. Harder, harder. So.\n\nEDGAR, [aside]\nO, matter and impertinency mixed,\nReason in madness!\n\nLEAR\nIf thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\nI know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.\nThou must be patient. We came crying hither;\nThou know'st the first time that we smell the air\nWe wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Alack, alack the day!\n\nLEAR\nWhen we are born, we cry that we are come\nTo this great stage of fools.--This' a good block.\nIt were a delicate stratagem to shoe\nA troop of horse with felt. I'll put 't in proof,\nAnd when I have stol'n upon these son-in-laws,\nThen kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\n\n[Enter a Gentleman and Attendants.]\n\n\nGENTLEMAN, [noticing Lear]\nO, here he is. [To an Attendant.] Lay hand upon\nhim.--Sir,\nYour most dear daughter--\n\nLEAR\nNo rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\nThe natural fool of Fortune. Use me well.\nYou shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;\nI am cut to th' brains.\n\nGENTLEMAN  You shall have anything.\n\nLEAR  No seconds? All myself?\nWhy, this would make a man a man of salt,\nTo use his eyes for garden waterpots,\nAy, and laying autumn's dust.\nI will die bravely like a smug bridegroom. What?\nI will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king,\nMasters, know you that?\n\nGENTLEMAN\nYou are a royal one, and we obey you.\n\nLEAR  Then there's life in 't. Come, an you get it, you\nshall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.\n[The King exits running pursued by Attendants.]\n\nGENTLEMAN\nA sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\nPast speaking of in a king. Thou hast a daughter\nWho redeems nature from the general curse\nWhich twain have brought her to.\n\nEDGAR  Hail, gentle sir.\n\nGENTLEMAN  Sir, speed you. What's your will?\n\nEDGAR\nDo you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\n\nGENTLEMAN\nMost sure and vulgar. Everyone hears that,\nWhich can distinguish sound.\n\nEDGAR  But, by your favor,\nHow near's the other army?\n\nGENTLEMAN\nNear and on speedy foot. The main descry\nStands on the hourly thought.\n\nEDGAR  I thank you, sir. That's all.\n\nGENTLEMAN\nThough that the Queen on special cause is here,\nHer army is moved on.\n\nEDGAR  I thank you, sir.\n[Gentleman exits.]\n\nGLOUCESTER\nYou ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;\nLet not my worser spirit tempt me again\nTo die before you please.\n\nEDGAR  Well pray you, father.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Now, good sir, what are you?\n\nEDGAR\nA most poor man, made tame to Fortune's blows,\nWho, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\nAm pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;\nI'll lead you to some biding.\n[He takes Gloucester's hand.]\n\nGLOUCESTER  Hearty thanks.\nThe bounty and the benison of heaven\nTo boot, and boot.\n\n[Enter Oswald, the Steward.]\n\n\nOSWALD, [drawing his sword]\nA proclaimed prize! Most happy!\nThat eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh\nTo raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,\nBriefly thyself remember; the sword is out\nThat must destroy thee.\n\nGLOUCESTER  Now let thy friendly hand\nPut strength enough to 't.\n[Edgar steps between Gloucester and Oswald.]\n\nOSWALD  Wherefore, bold peasant,\nDar'st thou support a published traitor? Hence,\nLest that th' infection of his fortune take\nLike hold on thee. Let go his arm.\n\nEDGAR  Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.\n\nOSWALD  Let go, slave, or thou diest!\n\nEDGAR  Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor\nvolk pass. An 'chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my\nlife, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.\nNay, come not near th' old man. Keep out,\nche vor' ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my\nballow be the harder. Chill be plain with you.\n\nOSWALD  Out, dunghill.\n\nEDGAR  Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come, no matter vor\nyour foins.\t[They fight.]\n\nOSWALD, [falling]\nSlave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.\nIf ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,\nAnd give the letters which thou find'st about me\nTo Edmund, Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out\nUpon the English party. O, untimely death! Death!\n[He dies.]\n\nEDGAR\nI know thee well, a serviceable villain,\nAs duteous to the vices of thy mistress\nAs badness would desire.\n\nGLOUCESTER  What, is he dead?\n\nEDGAR  Sit you down, father; rest you.\nLet's see these pockets. The letters that he speaks of\nMay be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry\nHe had no other deathsman. Let us see.\n[He opens a letter.]\nLeave, gentle wax, and, manners, blame us not.\nTo know our enemies' minds, we rip their hearts.\nTheir papers is more lawful.\t[Reads the letter.]\nLet our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have\nmany opportunities to cut him off. If your will want\nnot, time and place will be fruitfully offered. There is\nnothing done if he return the conqueror. Then am I\nthe prisoner, and his bed my jail, from the loathed\nwarmth whereof deliver me and supply the place for\nyour labor.\n\tYour (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant,\nand, for you, her own for venture,\tGoneril.\nO indistinguished space of woman's will!\nA plot upon her virtuous husband's life,\nAnd the exchange my brother.--Here, in the sands\nThee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified\nOf murderous lechers; and in the mature time\nWith this ungracious paper strike the sight\nOf the death-practiced duke. For him 'tis well\nThat of thy death and business I can tell.\n\nGLOUCESTER\nThe King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense\nThat I stand up and have ingenious feeling\nOf my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.\nSo should my thoughts be severed from my griefs,\nAnd woes, by wrong imaginations, lose\nThe knowledge of themselves.\t[Drum afar off.]\n\nEDGAR  Give me your hand.\nFar off methinks I hear the beaten drum.\nCome, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 7\n=======\n[Enter Cordelia, Kent in disguise, Doctor, and\nGentleman.]\n\n\nCORDELIA\nO, thou good Kent, how shall I live and work\nTo match thy goodness?

And wast thou fain, poor father,\nTo hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn\nIn short and musty straw? Alack, alack,\n'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once\nHad not concluded all.--He wakes.

Where I could not be honest,\nI never yet was valiant. For this business,\nIt touches us as France invades our land,\nNot bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,\nMost just and heavy causes make oppose.\n\nEDMUND\nSir, you speak nobly.\n\nREGAN  Why is this reasoned?\n\nGONERIL\nCombine together 'gainst the enemy,\nFor these domestic and particular broils\nAre not the question here.\n\nALBANY  Let's then determine\nWith th' ancient of war on our proceeding.\n\nEDMUND\nI shall attend you presently at your tent.\n\nREGAN  Sister, you'll go with us?\n\nGONERIL  No.\n\nREGAN\n'Tis most convenient.

Come on.\n\nGLOUCESTER  And that's true too.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter in conquest, with Drum and Colors, Edmund;\nLear and Cordelia as prisoners; Soldiers, Captain.]\n\n\nEDMUND\nSome officers take them away. Good guard\nUntil their greater pleasures first be known\nThat are to censure them.\n\nCORDELIA, [to Lear]  We are not the first\nWho with best meaning have incurred the worst.\nFor thee, oppressed king, I am cast down.\nMyself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.\nShall we not see these daughters and these sisters?\n\nLEAR\nNo, no, no, no. Come, let's away to prison.\nWe two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.\nWhen thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down\nAnd ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,\nAnd pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\nAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\nTalk of court news, and we'll talk with them too--\nWho loses and who wins; who's in, who's out--\nAnd take upon 's the mystery of things,\nAs if we were God's spies. And we'll wear out,\nIn a walled prison, packs and sects of great ones\nThat ebb and flow by th' moon.\n\nEDMUND  Take them away.\n\nLEAR\nUpon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,\nThe gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught\nthee?\nHe that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven\nAnd fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.\nThe good years shall devour them, flesh and fell,\nEre they shall make us weep. We'll see 'em starved\nfirst.\nCome.\n[Lear and Cordelia exit, with Soldiers.]\n\nEDMUND  Come hither, captain. Hark.\n[Handing him a paper.]\nTake thou this note. Go follow them to prison.\nOne step I have advanced thee. If thou dost\nAs this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way\nTo noble fortunes. Know thou this: that men\nAre as the time is; to be tender-minded\nDoes not become a sword. Thy great employment\nWill not bear question. Either say thou 'lt do 't,\nOr thrive by other means.\n\nCAPTAIN  I'll do 't, my lord.\n\nEDMUND\nAbout it, and write \"happy\" when th' hast done.\nMark, I say, instantly, and carry it so\nAs I have set it down.\n\nCAPTAIN\nI cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.\nIf it be man's work, I'll do 't.\t[Captain exits.]\n\n[Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers and a\nCaptain.]\n\n\nALBANY, [to Edmund]\nSir, you have showed today your valiant strain,\nAnd Fortune led you well. You have the captives\nWho were the opposites of this day's strife.\nI do require them of you, so to use them\nAs we shall find their merits and our safety\nMay equally determine.\n\nEDMUND  Sir, I thought it fit\nTo send the old and miserable king\nTo some retention and appointed guard,\nWhose age had charms in it, whose title more,\nTo pluck the common bosom on his side\nAnd turn our impressed lances in our eyes,\nWhich do command them. With him I sent the\nQueen,\nMy reason all the same, and they are ready\nTomorrow, or at further space, t' appear\nWhere you shall hold your session. At this time\nWe sweat and bleed. The friend hath lost his friend,\nAnd the best quarrels in the heat are cursed\nBy those that feel their sharpness.\nThe question of Cordelia and her father\nRequires a fitter place.\n\nALBANY  Sir, by your patience,\nI hold you but a subject of this war,\nNot as a brother.\n\nREGAN  That's as we list to grace him.\nMethinks our pleasure might have been demanded\nEre you had spoke so far. He led our powers,\nBore the commission of my place and person,\nThe which immediacy may well stand up\nAnd call itself your brother.\n\nGONERIL  Not so hot.\nIn his own grace he doth exalt himself\nMore than in your addition.\n\nREGAN  In my rights,\nBy me invested, he compeers the best.\n\nGONERIL\nThat were the most if he should husband you.\n\nREGAN\nJesters do oft prove prophets.\n\nGONERIL  Holla, holla!\nThat eye that told you so looked but asquint.\n\nREGAN\nLady, I am not well, else I should answer\nFrom a full-flowing stomach. [To Edmund.]\nGeneral,\nTake thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony.\nDispose of them, of me; the walls is thine.\nWitness the world that I create thee here\nMy lord and master.\n\nGONERIL  Mean you to enjoy him?\n\nALBANY\nThe let-alone lies not in your goodwill.\n\nEDMUND\nNor in thine, lord.\n\nALBANY  Half-blooded fellow, yes.\n\nREGAN, [to Edmund]\nLet the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\n\nALBANY\nStay yet, hear reason.--Edmund, I arrest thee\nOn capital treason; and, in thine attaint,\nThis gilded serpent.--For your claim, fair\nsister,\nI bar it in the interest of my wife.\n'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,\nAnd I, her husband, contradict your banns.\nIf you will marry, make your loves to me.\nMy lady is bespoke.\n\nGONERIL  An interlude!\n\nALBANY\nThou art armed, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.\nIf none appear to prove upon thy person\nThy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,\nThere is my pledge.\t[He throws down a glove.]\nI'll make it on thy heart,\nEre I taste bread, thou art in nothing less\nThan I have here proclaimed thee.\n\nREGAN  Sick, O, sick!\n\nGONERIL, [aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.\n\nEDMUND\nThere's my exchange.\t[He throws down a glove.]\nWhat in the world he is\nThat names me traitor, villain-like he lies.\nCall by the trumpet. He that dares approach,\nOn him, on you, who not, I will maintain\nMy truth and honor firmly.\n\nALBANY\nA herald, ho!\n\nEDMUND  A herald, ho, a herald!\n\nALBANY\nTrust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers,\nAll levied in my name, have in my name\nTook their discharge.\n\nREGAN  My sickness grows upon me.\n\nALBANY\nShe is not well. Convey her to my tent.\n[Regan is helped to exit.]\n\n[Enter a Herald.]\n\nCome hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,\nAnd read out this.\t[He hands the Herald a paper.]\n\nCAPTAIN  Sound, trumpet!\n[A trumpet sounds.]\n\nHERALD [reads.]\nIf any man of quality or degree, within the lists of the\narmy, will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of\nGloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him\nappear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in\nhis defense.\t[First trumpet sounds.]\n\nHERALD  Again!\t[Second trumpet sounds.]\n\nHERALD  Again!\t[Third trumpet sounds.]\n[Trumpet answers within.]\n\n[Enter Edgar armed.]\n\n\nALBANY, [to Herald]\nAsk him his purposes, why he appears\nUpon this call o' th' trumpet.\n\nHERALD  What are you?\nYour name, your quality, and why you answer\nThis present summons?\n\nEDGAR  Know my name is lost,\nBy treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.\nYet am I noble as the adversary\nI come to cope.\n\nALBANY  Which is that adversary?\n\nEDGAR\nWhat's he that speaks for Edmund, Earl of\nGloucester?\n\nEDMUND\nHimself. What sayest thou to him?\n\nEDGAR  Draw thy sword,\nThat if my speech offend a noble heart,\nThy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.\n[He draws his sword.]\nBehold, it is my privilege, the privilege of mine\nhonors,\nMy oath, and my profession. I protest,\nMaugre thy strength, place, youth, and eminence,\nDespite thy victor-sword and fire-new fortune,\nThy valor, and thy heart, thou art a traitor,\nFalse to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,\nConspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince,\nAnd from th' extremest upward of thy head\nTo the descent and dust below thy foot,\nA most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou \"no,\"\nThis sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent\nTo prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,\nThou liest.\n\nEDMUND  In wisdom I should ask thy name,\nBut since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,\nAnd that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,\nWhat safe and nicely I might well delay\nBy rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.\nBack do I toss these treasons to thy head,\nWith the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart,\nWhich, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,\nThis sword of mine shall give them instant way,\nWhere they shall rest forever. Trumpets, speak!\n[He draws his sword. Alarums. Fights.]\n[Edmund falls, wounded.]\n\nALBANY, [to Edgar]\nSave him, save him!\n\nGONERIL  This is practice, Gloucester.\nBy th' law of war, thou wast not bound to answer\nAn unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquished,\nBut cozened and beguiled.\n\nALBANY  Shut your mouth, dame,\nOr with this paper shall I stopple it.--Hold, sir.--\nThou worse than any name, read thine own evil.\nNo tearing, lady. I perceive you know it.\n\nGONERIL\nSay if I do; the laws are mine, not thine.\nWho can arraign me for 't?\n\nALBANY  Most monstrous! O!\nKnow'st thou this paper?\n\nGONERIL  Ask me not what I know.\n[She exits.]\n\nALBANY\nGo after her, she's desperate. Govern her.\n[A Soldier exits.]\n\nEDMUND, [to Edgar]\nWhat you have charged me with, that have I done,\nAnd more, much more. The time will bring it out.\n'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou\nThat hast this fortune on me? If thou 'rt noble,\nI do forgive thee.\n\nEDGAR  Let's exchange charity.\nI am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\nIf more, the more th' hast wronged me.\nMy name is Edgar and thy father's son.\nThe gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\nMake instruments to plague us.\nThe dark and vicious place where thee he got\nCost him his eyes.\n\nEDMUND  Th' hast spoken right. 'Tis true.\nThe wheel is come full circle; I am here.\n\nALBANY, [to Edgar]\nMethought thy very gait did prophesy\nA royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.\nLet sorrow split my heart if ever I\nDid hate thee or thy father!\n\nEDGAR  Worthy prince, I know 't.\n\nALBANY  Where have you hid yourself?\nHow have you known the miseries of your father?\n\nEDGAR\nBy nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale,\nAnd when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!\nThe bloody proclamation to escape\nThat followed me so near--O, our lives' sweetness,\nThat we the pain of death would hourly die\nRather than die at once!--taught me to shift\nInto a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance\nThat very dogs disdained, and in this habit\nMet I my father with his bleeding rings,\nTheir precious stones new lost; became his guide,\nLed him, begged for him, saved him from despair.\nNever--O fault!--revealed myself unto him\nUntil some half hour past, when I was armed.\nNot sure, though hoping of this good success,\nI asked his blessing, and from first to last\nTold him our pilgrimage. But his flawed heart\n(Alack, too weak the conflict to support)\n'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\nBurst smilingly.\n\nEDMUND  This speech of yours hath moved me,\nAnd shall perchance do good. But speak you on.\nYou look as you had something more to say.\n\nALBANY\nIf there be more, more woeful, hold it in,\nFor I am almost ready to dissolve,\nHearing of this.\n\nEDGAR  This would have seemed a period\nTo such as love not sorrow; but another,\nTo amplify too much, would make much more\nAnd top extremity. Whilst I\nWas big in clamor, came there in a man\nWho, having seen me in my worst estate,\nShunned my abhorred society; but then, finding\nWho 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms\nHe fastened on my neck and bellowed out\nAs he'd burst heaven, threw him on my father,\nTold the most piteous tale of Lear and him\nThat ever ear received, which, in recounting,\nHis grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\nBegan to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,\nAnd there I left him tranced.\n\nALBANY  But who was this?\n\nEDGAR\nKent, sir, the banished Kent, who in disguise\nFollowed his enemy king and did him service\nImproper for a slave.\n\n[Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.]\n\n\nGENTLEMAN\nHelp, help, O, help!\n\nEDGAR  What kind of help?\n\nALBANY, [to Gentleman]  Speak, man!\n\nEDGAR  What means this bloody knife?\n\nGENTLEMAN\n'Tis hot, it smokes! It came even from the heart\nOf--O, she's dead!\n\nALBANY  Who dead? Speak, man.\n\nGENTLEMAN\nYour lady, sir, your lady. And her sister\nBy her is poisoned. She confesses it.\n\nEDMUND\nI was contracted to them both. All three\nNow marry in an instant.\n\nEDGAR  Here comes Kent.\n\n[Enter Kent.]\n\n\nALBANY, [to the Gentleman]\nProduce the bodies, be they alive or dead.\n[Gentleman exits.]\nThis judgment of the heavens, that makes us\ntremble,\nTouches us not with pity. O, is this he?\n[To Kent.] The time will not allow the compliment\nWhich very manners urges.\n\nKENT  I am come\nTo bid my king and master aye goodnight.\nIs he not here?\n\nALBANY  Great thing of us forgot!\nSpeak, Edmund, where's the King? And where's\nCordelia?\n[Goneril and Regan's bodies brought out.]\nSeest thou this object, Kent?\n\nKENT  Alack, why thus?\n\nEDMUND  Yet Edmund was beloved.\nThe one the other poisoned for my sake,\nAnd after slew herself.\n\nALBANY  Even so.--Cover their faces.\n\nEDMUND\nI pant for life. Some good I mean to do\nDespite of mine own nature. Quickly send--\nBe brief in it--to th' castle, for my writ\nIs on the life of Lear, and on Cordelia.\nNay, send in time.\n\nALBANY  Run, run, O, run!\n\nEDGAR\nTo who, my lord? [To Edmund.] Who has the office?\nSend\nThy token of reprieve.\n\nEDMUND\nWell thought on. Take my sword. Give it the\nCaptain.\n\nEDGAR, [to a Soldier]  Haste thee for thy life.\n[The Soldier exits with Edmund's sword.]\n\nEDMUND, [to Albany]\nHe hath commission from thy wife and me\nTo hang Cordelia in the prison, and\nTo lay the blame upon her own despair,\nThat she fordid herself.\n\nALBANY\nThe gods defend her!--Bear him hence awhile.\n[Edmund is carried off.]\n\n[Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms,\nfollowed by a Gentleman.]\n\n\nLEAR\nHowl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!\nHad I your tongues and eyes, I'd use them so\nThat heaven's vault should crack. She's gone\nforever.\nI know when one is dead and when one lives.\nShe's dead as earth.--Lend me a looking glass.\nIf that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\nWhy, then she lives.\n\nKENT  Is this the promised end?\n\nEDGAR\nOr image of that horror?\n\nALBANY  Fall and cease.\n\nLEAR\nThis feather stirs. She lives. If it be so,\nIt is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\nThat ever I have felt.\n\nKENT  O, my good master--\n\nLEAR\nPrithee, away.\n\nEDGAR  'Tis noble Kent, your friend.\n\nLEAR\nA plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!\nI might have saved her. Now she's gone forever.--\nCordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!\nWhat is 't thou sayst?--Her voice was ever soft,\nGentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.\nI killed the slave that was a-hanging thee.\n\nGENTLEMAN\n'Tis true, my lords, he did.\n\nLEAR  Did I not, fellow?\nI have seen the day, with my good biting falchion\nI would have made him skip. I am old now,\nAnd these same crosses spoil me. [To Kent.] Who\nare you?\nMine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.\n\nKENT\nIf Fortune brag of two she loved and hated,\nOne of them we behold.\n\nLEAR\nThis is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?\n\nKENT  The same,\nYour servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?\n\nLEAR\nHe's a good fellow, I can tell you that.\nHe'll strike and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.\n\nKENT\nNo, my good lord, I am the very man--\n\nLEAR  I'll see that straight.\n\nKENT\nThat from your first of difference and decay\nHave followed your sad steps.\n\nLEAR  You are welcome\nhither.\n\nKENT\nNor no man else. All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.\nYour eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\nAnd desperately are dead.\n\nLEAR  Ay, so I think.\n\nALBANY\nHe knows not what he says, and vain is it\nThat we present us to him.\n\nEDGAR  Very bootless.\n\n[Enter a Messenger.]\n\n\nMESSENGER  Edmund is dead, my lord.\n\nALBANY  That's but a trifle here.--\nYou lords and noble friends, know our intent:\nWhat comfort to this great decay may come\nShall be applied. For us, we will resign,\nDuring the life of this old Majesty,\nTo him our absolute power; you to your rights,\nWith boot and such addition as your Honors\nHave more than merited. All friends shall taste\nThe wages of their virtue, and all foes\nThe cup of their deservings. O, see, see!\n\nLEAR\nAnd my poor fool is hanged. No, no, no life?\nWhy should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,\nAnd thou no breath at all? Thou 'lt come no more,\nNever, never, never, never, never.--\nPray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.\nDo you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,\nLook there, look there!\t[He dies.]\n\nEDGAR  He faints. [To Lear.] My lord,\nmy lord!\n\nKENT\nBreak, heart, I prithee, break!\n\nEDGAR  Look up, my lord.\n\nKENT\nVex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him\nThat would upon the rack of this tough world\nStretch him out longer.\n\nEDGAR  He is gone indeed.\n\nKENT\nThe wonder is he hath endured so long.\nHe but usurped his life.\n\nALBANY\nBear them from hence. Our present business\nIs general woe. [To Edgar and Kent.] Friends of my\nsoul, you twain\nRule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.\n\nKENT\nI have a journey, sir, shortly to go;\nMy master calls me. I must not say no.\n\nEDGAR\nThe weight of this sad time we must obey,\nSpeak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\nThe oldest hath borne most; we that are young\nShall never see so much nor live so long.\n[They exit with a dead march.]\n",

Therefore if thou art moved thou runn'st\naway.\n\nSAMPSON  A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I\nwill take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\n\nGREGORY  That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest\ngoes to the wall.\n\nSAMPSON  'Tis true, and therefore women, being the\nweaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore\nI will push Montague's men from the wall and\nthrust his maids to the wall.\n\nGREGORY  The quarrel is between our masters and us\ntheir men.\n\nSAMPSON  'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant.\nWhen I have fought with the men, I will be civil\nwith the maids; I will cut off their heads.\n\nGREGORY  The heads of the maids?\n\nSAMPSON  Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\nTake it in what sense thou wilt.\n\nGREGORY  They must take it in sense that feel it.\n\nSAMPSON  Me they shall feel while I am able to stand,\nand 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.\n\nGREGORY  'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou\nhadst been poor-john.

I will bite my thumb at\nthem, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.\n[He bites his thumb.]\n\nABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON  I do bite my thumb, sir.\n\nABRAM  Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON, [aside to Gregory]  Is the law of our side if I\nsay \"Ay\"?\n\nGREGORY, [aside to Sampson]  No.\n\nSAMPSON  No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,\nbut I bite my thumb, sir.\n\nGREGORY  Do you quarrel, sir?\n\nABRAM  Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\n\nSAMPSON  But if you do, sir, I am for you.

Put up thy sword,\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\n\nTYBALT\nWhat, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\nHave at thee, coward!\t[They fight.]\n\n[Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.]\n\n\nCITIZENS\nClubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\nDown with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\n\n[Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.]\n\n\nCAPULET\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\n\nLADY CAPULET\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a\nsword?\n\n[Enter old Montague and his Wife.]\n\nCAPULET\nMy sword, I say.

You men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins:\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\nThrow your mistempered weapons to the ground,\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\nThree civil brawls bred of an airy word\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\nHave thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets\nAnd made Verona's ancient citizens\nCast by their grave-beseeming ornaments\nTo wield old partisans in hands as old,\nCankered with peace, to part your cankered hate.\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time all the rest depart away.\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\nAnd, Montague, come you this afternoon\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\nTo old Free-town, our common judgment-place.\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\n[All but Montague, Lady Montague,\nand Benvolio exit.]\n\nMONTAGUE, [to Benvolio]\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\n\nBENVOLIO\nHere were the servants of your adversary,\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\nI drew to part them. In the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt with his sword prepared,\nWhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head and cut the winds,\nWho, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\nCame more and more and fought on part and part,\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\n\nLADY MONTAGUE\nO, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\n\nBENVOLIO\nMadam, an hour before the worshiped sun\nPeered forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\nSo early walking did I see your son.\nTowards him I made, but he was 'ware of me\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\nI, measuring his affections by my own\n(Which then most sought where most might not be\nfound,\nBeing one too many by my weary self),\nPursued my humor, not pursuing his,\nAnd gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.\n\nMONTAGUE\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\nAway from light steals home my heavy son\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\nBlack and portentous must this humor prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\n\nBENVOLIO\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\n\nMONTAGUE\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\n\nBENVOLIO\nHave you importuned him by any means?\n\nMONTAGUE\nBoth by myself and many other friends.\nBut he, his own affections' counselor,\nIs to himself--I will not say how true,\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\nOr dedicate his beauty to the same.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\n\n[Enter Romeo.]\n\n\nBENVOLIO\nSee where he comes. So please you, step aside.\nI'll know his grievance or be much denied.\n\nMONTAGUE\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\nTo hear true shrift.--Come, madam, let's away.\n[Montague and Lady Montague exit.]\n\nBENVOLIO\nGood morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO  Is the day so young?\n\nBENVOLIO\nBut new struck nine.\n\nROMEO  Ay me, sad hours seem long.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\n\nBENVOLIO\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\n\nROMEO\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\n\nBENVOLIO  In love?\n\nROMEO  Out--\n\nBENVOLIO  Of love?\n\nROMEO\nOut of her favor where I am in love.\n\nBENVOLIO\nAlas that love, so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\n\nROMEO\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould without eyes see pathways to his will!\nWhere shall we dine?--O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\nHere's much to do with hate, but more with love.\nWhy then, O brawling love, O loving hate,\nO anything of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness, serious vanity,\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,\nStill-waking sleep that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nDost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO  No, coz, I rather weep.\n\nROMEO\nGood heart, at what?\n\nBENVOLIO  At thy good heart's oppression.\n\nROMEO  Why, such is love's transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it pressed\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\nBeing purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\nBeing vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz.\n\nBENVOLIO  Soft, I will go along.\nAn if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\n\nROMEO\nTut, I have lost myself. I am not here.\nThis is not Romeo. He's some other where.\n\nBENVOLIO\nTell me in sadness, who is that you love?\n\nROMEO  What, shall I groan and tell thee?\n\nBENVOLIO\nGroan? Why, no. But sadly tell me who.\n\nROMEO\nA sick man in sadness makes his will--\nA word ill urged to one that is so ill.\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n\nBENVOLIO\nI aimed so near when I supposed you loved.\n\nROMEO\nA right good markman! And she's fair I love.\n\nBENVOLIO\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\n\nROMEO\nWell in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit\nWith Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,\nAnd, in strong proof of chastity well armed,\nFrom love's weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms,\nNor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\nO, she is rich in beauty, only poor\nThat, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\n\nBENVOLIO\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\n\nROMEO\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\nFor beauty, starved with her severity,\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\n\nBENVOLIO\nBe ruled by me. Forget to think of her.\n\nROMEO\nO, teach me how I should forget to think!\n\nBENVOLIO\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes.\nExamine other beauties.\n\nROMEO  'Tis the way\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair;\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\nWhere I may read who passed that passing fair?\nFarewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.\n\nBENVOLIO\nI'll pay that doctrine or else die in debt.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Capulet, County Paris, and a Servingman.]\n\n\nCAPULET\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike, and 'tis not hard, I think,\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\n\nPARIS\nOf honorable reckoning are you both,\nAnd pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.\nBut now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\n\nCAPULET\nBut saying o'er what I have said before.\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world.\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years.\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n\nPARIS\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\n\nCAPULET\nAnd too soon marred are those so early made.\nEarth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;\nShe's the hopeful lady of my earth.\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;\nMy will to her consent is but a part.\nAnd, she agreed, within her scope of choice\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustomed feast,\nWhereto I have invited many a guest\nSuch as I love; and you among the store,\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\nWhen well-appareled April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\nAmong fresh fennel buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house.

Well, Susan is with God;\nShe was too good for me. But, as I said,\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\nThat shall she. Marry, I remember it well.\n'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,\nAnd she was weaned (I never shall forget it)\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day.\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua.\nNay, I do bear a brain.

Were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst sucked wisdom from thy\nteat.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWell, think of marriage now. Younger than you\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers. By my count\nI was your mother much upon these years\nThat you are now a maid.

I am not for this ambling.\nBeing but heavy I will bear the light.\n\nMERCUTIO\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\n\nROMEO\nNot I, believe me. You have dancing shoes\nWith nimble soles. I have a soul of lead\nSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\n\nMERCUTIO\nYou are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings\nAnd soar with them above a common bound.\n\nROMEO\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.\nUnder love's heavy burden do I sink.\n\nMERCUTIO\nAnd to sink in it should you burden love--\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\n\nROMEO\nIs love a tender thing? It is too rough,\nToo rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.\n\nMERCUTIO\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love.\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.--\nGive me a case to put my visage in.--\nA visor for a visor.

Come, we burn daylight, ho!\n\nROMEO\nNay, that's not so.\n\nMERCUTIO  I mean, sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights; in vain, light lights by day.\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\n\nROMEO\nAnd we mean well in going to this masque,\nBut 'tis no wit to go.\n\nMERCUTIO  Why, may one ask?\n\nROMEO\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\n\nMERCUTIO  And so did I.\n\nROMEO\nWell, what was yours?\n\nMERCUTIO  That dreamers often lie.\n\nROMEO\nIn bed asleep while they do dream things true.\n\nMERCUTIO\nO, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate stone\nOn the forefinger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomi\nOver men's noses as they lie asleep.\nHer wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\nHer traces of the smallest spider web,\nHer collars of the moonshine's wat'ry beams,\nHer whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,\nHer wagoner a small gray-coated gnat,\nNot half so big as a round little worm\nPricked from the lazy finger of a maid.\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\nTime out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\nOn courtiers' knees, that dream on cur'sies straight;\nO'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;\nO'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.\nSometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit.\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,\nTickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep;\nThen he dreams of another benefice.\nSometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\nOf healths five fathom deep, and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes\nAnd, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\nWhich once untangled much misfortune bodes.\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage.\nThis is she--\n\nROMEO  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.\nThou talk'st of nothing.\n\nMERCUTIO  True, I talk of dreams,\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who woos\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north\nAnd, being angered, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south.\n\nBENVOLIO\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\n\nROMEO\nI fear too early, for my mind misgives\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night's revels, and expire the term\nOf a despised life closed in my breast\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\nDirect my sail.

Cast it off.\nIt is my lady. O, it is my love!\nO, that she knew she were!\nShe speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses; I will answer it.\nI am too bold. 'Tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those\nstars\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eye in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand.\nO, that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek!\n\nJULIET  Ay me.\n\nROMEO, [aside]  She speaks.\nO, speak again, bright angel, for thou art\nAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\nWhen he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\n\nJULIET\nO Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name,\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet.\n\nROMEO, [aside]\nShall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\n\nJULIET\n'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face. O, be some other name\nBelonging to a man.\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other word would smell as sweet.\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\nAnd, for thy name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\n\nROMEO  I take thee at thy word.\nCall me but love, and I'll be new baptized.\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\n\nJULIET\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreened in night,\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\n\nROMEO  By a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am.\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\n\nJULIET\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\n\nROMEO\nNeither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.\n\nJULIET\nHow camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\n\nROMEO\nWith love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls,\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt.\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.\n\nJULIET\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\n\nROMEO\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords.

But farewell compliment.\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say \"Ay,\"\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,\nThey say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\nOr, if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my havior light.\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more coying to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st ere I was ware\nMy true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\n\nROMEO\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--\n\nJULIET\nO, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\n\nROMEO\nWhat shall I swear by?\n\nJULIET  Do not swear at all.\nOr, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\n\nROMEO  If my heart's dear love--\n\nJULIET\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract tonight.\nIt is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say \"It lightens.\" Sweet, good night.\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast.\n\nROMEO\nO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\n\nJULIET\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\n\nROMEO\nTh' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\n\nJULIET\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it,\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\n\nROMEO\nWouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\n\nJULIET\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have.\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep. The more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\n[Nurse calls from within.]\nI hear some noise within.

O, for a falc'ner's voice\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\nWith repetition of \"My Romeo!\"\n\nROMEO\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\nLike softest music to attending ears.\n\nJULIET\nRomeo.\n\nROMEO  My dear.\n\nJULIET  What o'clock tomorrow\nShall I send to thee?\n\nROMEO  By the hour of nine.\n\nJULIET\nI will not fail.

I would have thee gone,\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton's bird,\nThat lets it hop a little from his hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silken thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\n\nROMEO\nI would I were thy bird.\n\nJULIET  Sweet, so would I.\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet\nsorrow\nThat I shall say \"Good night\" till it be morrow.\n[She exits.]\n\nROMEO\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\nWould I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest.\nHence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell,\nHis help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Friar Lawrence alone with a basket.]\n\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThe gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,\nCheck'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light,\nAnd fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels\nFrom forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\nThe day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,\nI must upfill this osier cage of ours\nWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\nThe Earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;\nWhat is her burying grave, that is her womb;\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind\nWe sucking on her natural bosom find,\nMany for many virtues excellent,\nNone but for some, and yet all different.\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\nIn plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.\nFor naught so vile that on the Earth doth live\nBut to the Earth some special good doth give;\nNor aught so good but, strained from that fair use,\nRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.\nVirtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,\nAnd vice sometime by action dignified.\n\n[Enter Romeo.]\n\nWithin the infant rind of this weak flower\nPoison hath residence and medicine power:\nFor this, being smelt, with that part cheers each\npart;\nBeing tasted, stays all senses with the heart.\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still\nIn man as well as herbs--grace and rude will;\nAnd where the worser is predominant,\nFull soon the canker death eats up that plant.\n\nROMEO\nGood morrow, father.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  Benedicite.\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\nYoung son, it argues a distempered head\nSo soon to bid \"Good morrow\" to thy bed.\nCare keeps his watch in every old man's eye,\nAnd, where care lodges, sleep will never lie;\nBut where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth\nreign.\nTherefore thy earliness doth me assure\nThou art uproused with some distemp'rature,\nOr, if not so, then here I hit it right:\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.\n\nROMEO\nThat last is true. The sweeter rest was mine.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nGod pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?\n\nROMEO\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.\nI have forgot that name and that name's woe.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThat's my good son. But where hast thou been\nthen?\n\nROMEO\nI'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me\nThat's by me wounded. Both our remedies\nWithin thy help and holy physic lies.\nI bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,\nMy intercession likewise steads my foe.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift.\nRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\n\nROMEO\nThen plainly know my heart's dear love is set\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet.\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,\nAnd all combined, save what thou must combine\nBy holy marriage. When and where and how\nWe met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow\nI'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,\nThat thou consent to marry us today.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHoly Saint Francis, what a change is here!\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\nSo soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\nHath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste!\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\nThy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears.\nLo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\nOf an old tear that is not washed off yet.\nIf e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline.\nAnd art thou changed? Pronounce this sentence\nthen:\nWomen may fall when there's no strength in men.\n\nROMEO\nThou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n\nROMEO\nAnd bad'st me bury love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  Not in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\n\nROMEO\nI pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow.\nThe other did not so.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  O, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote, that could not spell.\nBut come, young waverer, come, go with me.\nIn one respect I'll thy assistant be,\nFor this alliance may so happy prove\nTo turn your households' rancor to pure love.\n\nROMEO\nO, let us hence.

And\nis he a man to encounter Tybalt?\n\nBENVOLIO  Why, what is Tybalt?\n\nMERCUTIO  More than prince of cats. O, he's the courageous\ncaptain of compliments. He fights as you sing\nprick-song, keeps time, distance, and proportion.\nHe rests his minim rests, one, two, and the third in\nyour bosom--the very butcher of a silk button, a\nduelist, a duelist, a gentleman of the very first house\nof the first and second cause. Ah, the immortal\npassado, the punto reverso, the hay!\n\nBENVOLIO  The what?\n\nMERCUTIO  The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting\nphantasimes, these new tuners of accent: \"By\nJesu, a very good blade!

There's a French salutation to your French\nslop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.\n\nROMEO  Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit\ndid I give you?\n\nMERCUTIO  The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\n\nROMEO  Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was\ngreat, and in such a case as mine a man may strain\ncourtesy.\n\nMERCUTIO  That's as much as to say such a case as\nyours constrains a man to bow in the hams.\n\nROMEO  Meaning, to curtsy.\n\nMERCUTIO  Thou hast most kindly hit it.\n\nROMEO  A most courteous exposition.\n\nMERCUTIO  Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\n\nROMEO  \"Pink\" for flower.\n\nMERCUTIO  Right.\n\nROMEO  Why, then is my pump well flowered.\n\nMERCUTIO  Sure wit, follow me this jest now till thou\nhast worn out thy pump, that when the single sole\nof it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing,\nsolely singular.\n\nROMEO  O single-soled jest, solely singular for the\nsingleness.\n\nMERCUTIO  Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits\nfaints.\n\nROMEO  Switch and spurs, switch and spurs, or I'll cry\na match.\n\nMERCUTIO  Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I\nam done, for thou hast more of the wild goose in\none of thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole\nfive.

Now art thou sociable, now art thou\nRomeo, now art thou what thou art, by art as well as\nby nature. For this driveling love is like a great\nnatural that runs lolling up and down to hide his\nbauble in a hole.\n\nBENVOLIO  Stop there, stop there.\n\nMERCUTIO  Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against\nthe hair.\n\nBENVOLIO  Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\n\nMERCUTIO  O, thou art deceived.

I warrant\nyou, I dare draw as soon as another man, if I\nsee occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my\nside.\n\nNURSE  Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part\nabout me quivers. Scurvy knave! [To Romeo.] Pray\nyou, sir, a word. And, as I told you, my young lady\nbid me inquire you out. What she bid me say, I will\nkeep to myself. But first let me tell you, if you\nshould lead her in a fool's paradise, as they say, it\nwere a very gross kind of behavior, as they say. For\nthe gentlewoman is young; and therefore, if you\nshould deal double with her, truly it were an ill\nthing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and very\nweak dealing.\n\nROMEO  Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress.\nI protest unto thee--\n\nNURSE  Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much.\nLord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.\n\nROMEO  What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not\nmark me.\n\nNURSE  I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as\nI take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\n\nROMEO  Bid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon,\nAnd there she shall at Friar Lawrence' cell\nBe shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.\n[Offering her money.]\n\nNURSE  No, truly, sir, not a penny.\n\nROMEO  Go to, I say you shall.\n\nNURSE\nThis afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\n\nROMEO\nAnd stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.\nFarewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\n\nNURSE\nNow, God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\n\nROMEO  What sayst thou, my dear nurse?\n\nNURSE\nIs your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say\n\"Two may keep counsel, putting one away\"?\n\nROMEO\nWarrant thee, my man's as true as steel.\n\nNURSE  Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord,\nLord, when 'twas a little prating thing--O, there is\na nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain lay\nknife aboard, but she, good soul, had as lief see a\ntoad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes\nand tell her that Paris is the properer man, but I'll\nwarrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\nclout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and\nRomeo begin both with a letter?\n\nROMEO  Ay, nurse, what of that? Both with an R.\n\nNURSE  Ah, mocker, that's the dog's name. R is for\nthe--No, I know it begins with some other letter,\nand she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you\nand rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.\n\nROMEO  Commend me to thy lady.\n\nNURSE  Ay, a thousand times.--Peter.\n\nPETER  Anon.\n\nNURSE  Before and apace.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n[Enter Juliet.]\n\n\nJULIET\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\nPerchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.\nO, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,\nWhich ten times faster glides than the sun's beams,\nDriving back shadows over louring hills.\nTherefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day's journey, and from nine till twelve\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\nShe would be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me.\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead,\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.\n\n[Enter Nurse and Peter.]\n\nO God, she comes!--O, honey nurse, what news?\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\n\nNURSE  Peter, stay at the gate.\t[Peter exits.]\n\nJULIET\nNow, good sweet nurse--O Lord, why lookest thou\nsad?\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily.\nIf good, thou shamest the music of sweet news\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\n\nNURSE\nI am aweary. Give me leave awhile.\nFie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I!\n\nJULIET\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.\nNay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good nurse,\nspeak.\n\nNURSE\nJesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?\nDo you not see that I am out of breath?\n\nJULIET\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good or bad? Answer to that.\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance.\nLet me be satisfied; is 't good or bad?\n\nNURSE  Well, you have made a simple choice. You know\nnot how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he.\nThough his face be better than any man's, yet his leg\nexcels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a\nbody, though they be not to be talked on, yet they\nare past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy,\nbut I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\nways, wench. Serve God. What, have you dined at\nhome?\n\nJULIET\nNo, no. But all this did I know before.\nWhat says he of our marriage? What of that?\n\nNURSE\nLord, how my head aches! What a head have I!\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\nMy back o' t' other side! Ah, my back, my back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about\nTo catch my death with jaunting up and down.\n\nJULIET\nI' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\nSweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my\nlove?\n\nNURSE  Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a\ncourteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I\nwarrant, a virtuous--Where is your mother?\n\nJULIET\nWhere is my mother? Why, she is within.\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest:\n\"Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\nWhere is your mother?\"\n\nNURSE  O God's lady dear,\nAre you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\n\nJULIET\nHere's such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?\n\nNURSE\nHave you got leave to go to shrift today?\n\nJULIET  I have.\n\nNURSE\nThen hie you hence to Friar Lawrence' cell.\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife.\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks;\nThey'll be in scarlet straight at any news.\nHie you to church. I must another way,\nTo fetch a ladder by the which your love\nMust climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.\nI am the drudge and toil in your delight,\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\nGo. I'll to dinner. Hie you to the cell.\n\nJULIET\nHie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 6\n=======\n[Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.]\n\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act\nThat after-hours with sorrow chide us not.\n\nROMEO\nAmen, amen. But come what sorrow can,\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight.\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare,\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThese violent delights have violent ends\nAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\nWhich, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\nTherefore love moderately. Long love doth so.\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\n\n[Enter Juliet.]\n\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\nWill ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.\nA lover may bestride the gossamers\nThat idles in the wanton summer air,\nAnd yet not fall, so light is vanity.\n\nJULIET\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\n\nJULIET\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\n\nROMEO\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\nBe heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\nThis neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue\nUnfold the imagined happiness that both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\n\nJULIET\nConceit, more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth,\nBut my true love is grown to such excess\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work,\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\nTill Holy Church incorporate two in one.\n[They exit.]\n\n\nACT 3\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and their men.]\n\n\nBENVOLIO\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.\nThe day is hot, the Capels are abroad,\nAnd if we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl,\nFor now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\n\nMERCUTIO  Thou art like one of these fellows that, when\nhe enters the confines of a tavern, claps me his\nsword upon the table and says \"God send me no\nneed of thee\" and, by the operation of the second\ncup, draws him on the drawer when indeed there is\nno need.\n\nBENVOLIO  Am I like such a fellow?\n\nMERCUTIO  Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy\nmood as any in Italy, and as soon moved to be\nmoody, and as soon moody to be moved.\n\nBENVOLIO  And what to?\n\nMERCUTIO  Nay, an there were two such, we should\nhave none shortly, for one would kill the other.\nThou--why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that\nhath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than\nthou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking\nnuts, having no other reason but because thou\nhast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy\nout such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels as\nan egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been\nbeaten as addle as an egg for quarreling. Thou hast\nquarreled with a man for coughing in the street\nbecause he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain\nasleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a tailor\nfor wearing his new doublet before Easter? With\nanother, for tying his new shoes with old ribbon?\nAnd yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling?\n\nBENVOLIO  An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any\nman should buy the fee simple of my life for an\nhour and a quarter.\n\nMERCUTIO  The fee simple? O simple!\n\n[Enter Tybalt, Petruchio, and others.]\n\n\nBENVOLIO  By my head, here comes the Capulets.\n\nMERCUTIO  By my heel, I care not.\n\nTYBALT, [to his companions]\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.--\nGentlemen, good e'en. A word with one of you.\n\nMERCUTIO  And but one word with one of us? Couple it\nwith something. Make it a word and a blow.\n\nTYBALT  You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an\nyou will give me occasion.\n\nMERCUTIO  Could you not take some occasion without\ngiving?\n\nTYBALT  Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.\n\nMERCUTIO  Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels?\nAn thou make minstrels of us, look to hear\nnothing but discords. Here's my fiddlestick; here's\nthat shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!\n\nBENVOLIO\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men.\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\nOr reason coldly of your grievances,\nOr else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.\n\nMERCUTIO\nMen's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.\nI will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.\n\n[Enter Romeo.]\n\n\nTYBALT\nWell, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.\n\nMERCUTIO\nBut I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.\nMarry, go before to field, he'll be your follower.\nYour Worship in that sense may call him \"man.\"\n\nTYBALT\nRomeo, the love I bear thee can afford\nNo better term than this: thou art a villain.\n\nROMEO\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\nTo such a greeting. Villain am I none.\nTherefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.\n\nTYBALT\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\nThat thou hast done me. Therefore turn and draw.\n\nROMEO\nI do protest I never injured thee\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love.\nAnd so, good Capulet, which name I tender\nAs dearly as mine own, be satisfied.\n\nMERCUTIO\nO calm, dishonorable, vile submission!\nAlla stoccato carries it away.\t[He draws.]\nTybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?\n\nTYBALT  What wouldst thou have with me?\n\nMERCUTIO  Good king of cats, nothing but one of your\nnine lives, that I mean to make bold withal, and, as\nyou shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest of the\neight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher\nby the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your\nears ere it be out.\n\nTYBALT  I am for you.\t[He draws.]\n\nROMEO\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\n\nMERCUTIO  Come, sir, your passado.\t[They fight.]\n\nROMEO\nDraw, Benvolio, beat down their weapons.\n[Romeo draws.]\nGentlemen, for shame forbear this outrage!\nTybalt! Mercutio! The Prince expressly hath\nForbid this bandying in Verona streets.\nHold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!\n[Romeo attempts to beat down their rapiers.\nTybalt stabs Mercutio.]\n\nPETRUCHIO  Away, Tybalt!\n[Tybalt, Petruchio, and their followers exit.]\n\nMERCUTIO  I am hurt.\nA plague o' both houses! I am sped.\nIs he gone and hath nothing?\n\nBENVOLIO  What, art thou hurt?\n\nMERCUTIO\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.\nWhere is my page?--Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.\n[Page exits.]\n\nROMEO\nCourage, man, the hurt cannot be much.\n\nMERCUTIO  No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as\na church door, but 'tis enough. 'Twill serve. Ask for\nme tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I\nam peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'\nboth your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a\ncat, to scratch a man to death! A braggart, a rogue, a\nvillain that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the\ndevil came you between us? I was hurt under your\narm.\n\nROMEO  I thought all for the best.\n\nMERCUTIO\nHelp me into some house, Benvolio,\nOr I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!\nThey have made worms' meat of me.\nI have it, and soundly, too. Your houses!\n[All but Romeo exit.]\n\nROMEO\nThis gentleman, the Prince's near ally,\nMy very friend, hath got this mortal hurt\nIn my behalf. My reputation stained\nWith Tybalt's slander--Tybalt, that an hour\nHath been my cousin! O sweet Juliet,\nThy beauty hath made me effeminate\nAnd in my temper softened valor's steel.\n\n[Enter Benvolio.]\n\n\nBENVOLIO\nO Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.\nThat gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,\nWhich too untimely here did scorn the earth.\n\nROMEO\nThis day's black fate on more days doth depend.\nThis but begins the woe others must end.\n\n[Enter Tybalt.]\n\n\nBENVOLIO\nHere comes the furious Tybalt back again.\n\nROMEO\nAlive in triumph, and Mercutio slain!\nAway to heaven, respective lenity,\nAnd fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.--\nNow, Tybalt, take the \"villain\" back again\nThat late thou gavest me, for Mercutio's soul\nIs but a little way above our heads,\nStaying for thine to keep him company.\nEither thou or I, or both, must go with him.\n\nTYBALT\nThou wretched boy that didst consort him here\nShalt with him hence.\n\nROMEO  This shall determine that.\n[They fight. Tybalt falls.]\n\nBENVOLIO\nRomeo, away, begone!\nThe citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.\nStand not amazed. The Prince will doom thee death\nIf thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away.\n\nROMEO\nO, I am Fortune's fool!\n\nBENVOLIO  Why dost thou stay?\n[Romeo exits.]\n\n[Enter Citizens.]\n\n\nCITIZEN\nWhich way ran he that killed Mercutio?\nTybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?\n\nBENVOLIO\nThere lies that Tybalt.\n\nCITIZEN, [to Tybalt]  Up, sir, go with me.\nI charge thee in the Prince's name, obey.\n\n[Enter Prince, old Montague, Capulet, their Wives and all.]\n\n\nPRINCE\nWhere are the vile beginners of this fray?\n\nBENVOLIO\nO noble prince, I can discover all\nThe unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.\nThere lies the man, slain by young Romeo,\nThat slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nTybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child!\nO prince! O cousin! Husband! O, the blood is spilled\nOf my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,\nFor blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.\nO cousin, cousin!\n\nPRINCE\nBenvolio, who began this bloody fray?\n\nBENVOLIO\nTybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay--\nRomeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink\nHow nice the quarrel was, and urged withal\nYour high displeasure. All this uttered\nWith gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed\nCould not take truce with the unruly spleen\nOf Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts\nWith piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,\nWho, all as hot, turns deadly point to point\nAnd, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats\nCold death aside and with the other sends\nIt back to Tybalt, whose dexterity\nRetorts it. Romeo he cries aloud\n\"Hold, friends! Friends, part!\" and swifter than his\ntongue\nHis agile arm beats down their fatal points,\nAnd 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm\nAn envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life\nOf stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.\nBut by and by comes back to Romeo,\nWho had but newly entertained revenge,\nAnd to 't they go like lightning, for ere I\nCould draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain,\nAnd, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.\nThis is the truth, or let Benvolio die.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nHe is a kinsman to the Montague.\nAffection makes him false; he speaks not true.\nSome twenty of them fought in this black strife,\nAnd all those twenty could but kill one life.\nI beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.\nRomeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.\n\nPRINCE\nRomeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.\nWho now the price of his dear blood doth owe?\n\nMONTAGUE\nNot Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend.\nHis fault concludes but what the law should end,\nThe life of Tybalt.\n\nPRINCE  And for that offense\nImmediately we do exile him hence.\nI have an interest in your hearts' proceeding:\nMy blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.\nBut I'll amerce you with so strong a fine\nThat you shall all repent the loss of mine.\nI will be deaf to pleading and excuses.\nNor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.\nTherefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,\nElse, when he is found, that hour is his last.\nBear hence this body and attend our will.\nMercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.\n[They exit, the Capulet men\nbearing off Tybalt's body.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Juliet alone.]\n\n\nJULIET\nGallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,\nTowards Phoebus' lodging. Such a wagoner\nAs Phaeton would whip you to the west\nAnd bring in cloudy night immediately.\nSpread thy close curtain, love-performing night,\nThat runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo\nLeap to these arms, untalked of and unseen.\nLovers can see to do their amorous rites\nBy their own beauties, or, if love be blind,\nIt best agrees with night. Come, civil night,\nThou sober-suited matron all in black,\nAnd learn me how to lose a winning match\nPlayed for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.\nHood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,\nWith thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,\nThink true love acted simple modesty.\nCome, night. Come, Romeo. Come, thou day in\nnight,\nFor thou wilt lie upon the wings of night\nWhiter than new snow upon a raven's back.\nCome, gentle night; come, loving black-browed\nnight,\nGive me my Romeo, and when I shall die,\nTake him and cut him out in little stars,\nAnd he will make the face of heaven so fine\nThat all the world will be in love with night\nAnd pay no worship to the garish sun.\nO, I have bought the mansion of a love\nBut not possessed it, and, though I am sold,\nNot yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day\nAs is the night before some festival\nTo an impatient child that hath new robes\nAnd may not wear them.\n\n[Enter Nurse with cords.]\n\nO, here comes my nurse,\nAnd she brings news, and every tongue that speaks\nBut Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.--\nNow, nurse, what news?

O Romeo, Romeo,\nWhoever would have thought it? Romeo!\n\nJULIET\nWhat devil art thou that dost torment me thus?\nThis torture should be roared in dismal hell.\nHath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but \"Ay,\"\nAnd that bare vowel \"I\" shall poison more\nThan the death-darting eye of cockatrice.\nI am not I if there be such an \"I,\"\nOr those eyes shut that makes thee answer \"Ay.\"\nIf he be slain, say \"Ay,\" or if not, \"No.\"\nBrief sounds determine my weal or woe.\n\nNURSE\nI saw the wound. I saw it with mine eyes\n(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast--\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaubed in blood,\nAll in gore blood.

Give me some aqua vitae.\nThese griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me\nold.\nShame come to Romeo!\n\nJULIET  Blistered be thy tongue\nFor such a wish! He was not born to shame.\nUpon his brow shame is ashamed to sit,\nFor 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned\nSole monarch of the universal Earth.\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\n\nNURSE\nWill you speak well of him that killed your cousin?\n\nJULIET\nShall I speak ill of him that is my husband?\nAh, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy\nname\nWhen I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?\nBut wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?\nThat villain cousin would have killed my husband.\nBack, foolish tears, back to your native spring;\nYour tributary drops belong to woe,\nWhich you, mistaking, offer up to joy.\nMy husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,\nAnd Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my\nhusband.\nAll this is comfort. Wherefore weep I then?\nSome word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,\nThat murdered me. I would forget it fain,\nBut, O, it presses to my memory\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:\n\"Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished.\"\nThat \"banished,\" that one word \"banished,\"\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death\nWas woe enough if it had ended there;\nOr, if sour woe delights in fellowship\nAnd needly will be ranked with other griefs,\nWhy followed not, when she said \"Tybalt's dead,\"\n\"Thy father\" or \"thy mother,\" nay, or both,\nWhich modern lamentation might have moved?\nBut with a rearward following Tybalt's death,\n\"Romeo is banished.\" To speak that word\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\nAll slain, all dead. \"Romeo is banished.\"\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\nIn that word's death.

What is the Prince's doom?\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand\nThat I yet know not?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  Too familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.\n\nROMEO\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nA gentler judgment vanished from his lips:\nNot body's death, but body's banishment.\n\nROMEO\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say \"death,\"\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\nMuch more than death. Do not say \"banishment.\"\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHere from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\n\nROMEO\nThere is no world without Verona walls\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\nHence \"banished\" is \"banished from the world,\"\nAnd world's exile is death. Then \"banished\"\nIs death mistermed. Calling death \"banished,\"\nThou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\nThy fault our law calls death, but the kind prince,\nTaking thy part, hath rushed aside the law\nAnd turned that black word \"death\" to\n\"banishment.\"\nThis is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\n\nROMEO\n'Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honorable state, more courtship lives\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho even in pure and vestal modesty\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\nBut Romeo may not; he is banished.\nFlies may do this, but I from this must fly.\nThey are free men, but I am banished.\nAnd sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground\nknife,\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,\nBut \"banished\" to kill me? \"Banished\"?\nO friar, the damned use that word in hell.\nHowling attends it. How hast thou the heart,\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin absolver, and my friend professed,\nTo mangle me with that word \"banished\"?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\n\nROMEO\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nI'll give thee armor to keep off that word,\nAdversity's sweet milk, philosophy,\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\n\nROMEO\nYet \"banished\"? Hang up philosophy.\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\nDisplant a town, reverse a prince's doom,\nIt helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nO, then I see that madmen have no ears.\n\nROMEO\nHow should they when that wise men have no eyes?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate.\n\nROMEO\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy\nhair\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,\n[Romeo throws himself down.]\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\n[Knock within.]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nArise. One knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\n\nROMEO\nNot I, unless the breath of heartsick groans,\nMistlike, enfold me from the search of eyes.\n[Knock.]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHark, how they knock!--Who's there?--Romeo,\narise.\nThou wilt be taken.--Stay awhile.--Stand up.\n[Knock.]\nRun to my study.--By and by.--God's will,\nWhat simpleness is this?--I come, I come.\n[Knock.]\nWho knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's\nyour will?\n\nNURSE, [within]\nLet me come in, and you shall know my errand.\nI come from Lady Juliet.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE, [admitting the Nurse]\nWelcome, then.\n\n[Enter Nurse.]\n\n\nNURSE\nO holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,\nWhere's my lady's lord? Where's Romeo?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThere on the ground, with his own tears made\ndrunk.\n\nNURSE\nO, he is even in my mistress' case,\nJust in her case. O woeful sympathy!\nPiteous predicament!

Stand an you be a man.\nFor Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand.\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\n\nROMEO  Nurse.\n\nNURSE\nAh sir, ah sir, death's the end of all.\n\nROMEO, [rising up]\nSpakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murderer,\nNow I have stained the childhood of our joy\nWith blood removed but little from her own?\nWhere is she? And how doth she? And what says\nMy concealed lady to our canceled love?\n\nNURSE\nO, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\nAnd \"Tybalt\" calls, and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again.\n\nROMEO  As if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\nDid murder her, as that name's cursed hand\nMurdered her kinsman.--O, tell me, friar, tell me,\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\nThe hateful mansion.\t[He draws his dagger.]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  Hold thy desperate hand!\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.\nThy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast.\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man,\nAnd ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\nThou hast amazed me. By my holy order,\nI thought thy disposition better tempered.\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself,\nAnd slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\nWhy railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth,\nSince birth and heaven and earth all three do meet\nIn thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose?\nFie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound'st in all\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax,\nDigressing from the valor of a man;\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\nKilling that love which thou hast vowed to cherish;\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\nLike powder in a skilless soldier's flask,\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\nAnd thou dismembered with thine own defense.\nWhat, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead:\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\nBut thou slewest Tybalt: there art thou happy.\nThe law that threatened death becomes thy friend\nAnd turns it to exile: there art thou happy.\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;\nHappiness courts thee in her best array;\nBut, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,\nThou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love.\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\nGo, get thee to thy love, as was decreed.\nAscend her chamber. Hence and comfort her.\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set,\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\nWhere thou shalt live till we can find a time\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\nBeg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy\nThan thou went'st forth in lamentation.--\nGo before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\nAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed,\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\nRomeo is coming.\n\nNURSE\nO Lord, I could have stayed here all the night\nTo hear good counsel.

I'll find out your man,\nAnd he shall signify from time to time\nEvery good hap to you that chances here.\nGive me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell. Good night.\n\nROMEO\nBut that a joy past joy calls out on me,\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee.\nFarewell.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.]\n\n\nCAPULET\nThings have fallen out, sir, so unluckily\nThat we have had no time to move our daughter.\nLook you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,\nAnd so did I. Well, we were born to die.\n'Tis very late. She'll not come down tonight.\nI promise you, but for your company,\nI would have been abed an hour ago.\n\nPARIS\nThese times of woe afford no times to woo.--\nMadam, good night.

I think she will be ruled\nIn all respects by me. Nay, more, I doubt it not.--\nWife, go you to her ere you go to bed.\nAcquaint her here of my son Paris' love,\nAnd bid her--mark you me?--on Wednesday\nnext--\nBut soft, what day is this?\n\nPARIS  Monday, my lord.\n\nCAPULET\nMonday, ha ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.\nO' Thursday let it be.--O' Thursday, tell her,\nShe shall be married to this noble earl.--\nWill you be ready? Do you like this haste?\nWe'll keep no great ado: a friend or two.\nFor hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,\nIt may be thought we held him carelessly,\nBeing our kinsman, if we revel much.\nTherefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,\nAnd there an end. But what say you to Thursday?\n\nPARIS\nMy lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.\n\nCAPULET\nWell, get you gone. O' Thursday be it, then.\n[To Lady Capulet.] Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.\nPrepare her, wife, against this wedding day.--\nFarewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!--\nAfore me, it is so very late that we\nMay call it early by and by.--Good night.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n[Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft.]\n\n\nJULIET\nWilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.\nIt was the nightingale, and not the lark,\nThat pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.\nNightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.\nBelieve me, love, it was the nightingale.\n\nROMEO\nIt was the lark, the herald of the morn,\nNo nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks\nDo lace the severing clouds in yonder east.\nNight's candles are burnt out, and jocund day\nStands tiptoe on the misty mountain-tops.\nI must be gone and live, or stay and die.\n\nJULIET\nYond light is not daylight, I know it, I.\nIt is some meteor that the sun exhaled\nTo be to thee this night a torchbearer\nAnd light thee on thy way to Mantua.\nTherefore stay yet. Thou need'st not to be gone.\n\nROMEO\nLet me be ta'en; let me be put to death.\nI am content, so thou wilt have it so.\nI'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye;\n'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow.\nNor that is not the lark whose notes do beat\nThe vaulty heaven so high above our heads.\nI have more care to stay than will to go.\nCome death and welcome. Juliet wills it so.\nHow is 't, my soul? Let's talk. It is not day.\n\nJULIET\nIt is, it is. Hie hence, begone, away!\nIt is the lark that sings so out of tune,\nStraining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.\nSome say the lark makes sweet division.\nThis doth not so, for she divideth us.\nSome say the lark and loathed toad changed eyes.\nO, now I would they had changed voices too,\nSince arm from arm that voice doth us affray,\nHunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.\nO, now begone. More light and light it grows.\n\nROMEO\nMore light and light, more dark and dark our woes.\n\n[Enter Nurse.]\n\n\nNURSE  Madam.\n\nJULIET  Nurse?\n\nNURSE\nYour lady mother is coming to your chamber.\nThe day is broke; be wary; look about.\t[She exits.]\n\nJULIET\nThen, window, let day in, and let life out.\n\nROMEO\nFarewell, farewell.

Some grief shows much of\nlove,\nBut much of grief shows still some want of wit.\n\nJULIET\nYet let me weep for such a feeling loss.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nSo shall you feel the loss, but not the friend\nWhich you weep for.\n\nJULIET  Feeling so the loss,\nI cannot choose but ever weep the friend.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWell, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death\nAs that the villain lives which slaughtered him.\n\nJULIET\nWhat villain, madam?\n\nLADY CAPULET  That same villain, Romeo.\n\nJULIET, [aside]\nVillain and he be many miles asunder.--\nGod pardon him. I do with all my heart,\nAnd yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nThat is because the traitor murderer lives.\n\nJULIET\nAy, madam, from the reach of these my hands.\nWould none but I might venge my cousin's death!\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWe will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.\nThen weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,\nWhere that same banished runagate doth live,\nShall give him such an unaccustomed dram\nThat he shall soon keep Tybalt company.\nAnd then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.\n\nJULIET\nIndeed, I never shall be satisfied\nWith Romeo till I behold him--dead--\nIs my poor heart, so for a kinsman vexed.\nMadam, if you could find out but a man\nTo bear a poison, I would temper it,\nThat Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,\nSoon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors\nTo hear him named and cannot come to him\nTo wreak the love I bore my cousin\nUpon his body that hath slaughtered him.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nFind thou the means, and I'll find such a man.\nBut now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.\n\nJULIET\nAnd joy comes well in such a needy time.\nWhat are they, beseech your Ladyship?\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWell, well, thou hast a careful father, child,\nOne who, to put thee from thy heaviness,\nHath sorted out a sudden day of joy\nThat thou expects not, nor I looked not for.\n\nJULIET\nMadam, in happy time! What day is that?\n\nLADY CAPULET\nMarry, my child, early next Thursday morn\nThe gallant, young, and noble gentleman,\nThe County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church\nShall happily make thee there a joyful bride.\n\nJULIET\nNow, by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,\nHe shall not make me there a joyful bride!\nI wonder at this haste, that I must wed\nEre he that should be husband comes to woo.\nI pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,\nI will not marry yet, and when I do I swear\nIt shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,\nRather than Paris. These are news indeed!\n\nLADY CAPULET\nHere comes your father. Tell him so yourself,\nAnd see how he will take it at your hands.\n\n[Enter Capulet and Nurse.]\n\n\nCAPULET\nWhen the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,\nBut for the sunset of my brother's son\nIt rains downright.\nHow now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?\nEvermore show'ring? In one little body\nThou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.\nFor still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,\nDo ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,\nSailing in this salt flood; the winds thy sighs,\nWho, raging with thy tears and they with them,\nWithout a sudden calm, will overset\nThy tempest-tossed body.--How now, wife?\nHave you delivered to her our decree?\n\nLADY CAPULET\nAy, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.\nI would the fool were married to her grave.\n\nCAPULET\nSoft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.\nHow, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?\nIs she not proud? Doth she not count her blessed,\nUnworthy as she is, that we have wrought\nSo worthy a gentleman to be her bride?\n\nJULIET\nNot proud you have, but thankful that you have.\nProud can I never be of what I hate,\nBut thankful even for hate that is meant love.\n\nCAPULET\nHow, how, how, how? Chopped logic? What is this?\n\"Proud,\" and \"I thank you,\" and \"I thank you not,\"\nAnd yet \"not proud\"? Mistress minion you,\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\nBut fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\nOut, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!\nYou tallow face!\n\nLADY CAPULET  Fie, fie, what, are you mad?\n\nJULIET, [kneeling]\nGood father, I beseech you on my knees,\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\n\nCAPULET\nHang thee, young baggage, disobedient wretch!\nI tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,\nOr never after look me in the face.\nSpeak not; reply not; do not answer me.\nMy fingers itch.--Wife, we scarce thought us\nblessed\nThat God had lent us but this only child,\nBut now I see this one is one too much,\nAnd that we have a curse in having her.\nOut on her, hilding.\n\nNURSE  God in heaven bless her!\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\n\nCAPULET\nAnd why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue.\nGood Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.\n\nNURSE\nI speak no treason.\n\nCAPULET  O, God 'i' g' eden!\n\nNURSE\nMay not one speak?\n\nCAPULET  Peace, you mumbling fool!\nUtter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,\nFor here we need it not.\n\nLADY CAPULET  You are too hot.\n\nCAPULET  God's bread, it makes me mad.\nDay, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,\nAlone, in company, still my care hath been\nTo have her matched. And having now provided\nA gentleman of noble parentage,\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly ligned,\nStuffed, as they say, with honorable parts,\nProportioned as one's thought would wish a man--\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool,\nA whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,\nTo answer \"I'll not wed. I cannot love.\nI am too young. I pray you, pardon me.\"\nBut, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you!\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me.\nLook to 't; think on 't. I do not use to jest.\nThursday is near. Lay hand on heart; advise.\nAn you be mine, I'll give you to my friend.\nAn you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\nFor, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good.\nTrust to 't; bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.\n[He exits.]\n\nJULIET\nIs there no pity sitting in the clouds\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?--\nO sweet my mother, cast me not away.\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week,\nOr, if you do not, make the bridal bed\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nTalk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.\nDo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.\n[She exits.]\n\nJULIET, [rising]\nO God! O nurse, how shall this be prevented?\nMy husband is on Earth, my faith in heaven.\nHow shall that faith return again to Earth\nUnless that husband send it me from heaven\nBy leaving Earth? Comfort me; counsel me.--\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems\nUpon so soft a subject as myself.--\nWhat sayst thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\nSome comfort, nurse.\n\nNURSE  Faith, here it is.\nRomeo is banished, and all the world to nothing\nThat he dares ne'er come back to challenge you,\nOr, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\nThen, since the case so stands as now it doth,\nI think it best you married with the County.\nO, he's a lovely gentleman!\nRomeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\nHath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\nI think you are happy in this second match,\nFor it excels your first, or, if it did not,\nYour first is dead, or 'twere as good he were\nAs living here and you no use of him.\n\nJULIET\nSpeak'st thou from thy heart?\n\nNURSE\nAnd from my soul too, else beshrew them both.\n\nJULIET  Amen.\n\nNURSE  What?\n\nJULIET\nWell, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.\nGo in and tell my lady I am gone,\nHaving displeased my father, to Lawrence' cell\nTo make confession and to be absolved.\n\nNURSE\nMarry, I will; and this is wisely done.\t[She exits.]\n\nJULIET\nAncient damnation, O most wicked fiend!\nIs it more sin to wish me thus forsworn\nOr to dispraise my lord with that same tongue\nWhich she hath praised him with above compare\nSo many thousand times? Go, counselor.\nThou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.\nI'll to the Friar to know his remedy.\nIf all else fail, myself have power to die.\n[She exits.]\n\n\nACT 4\n=====\n\nScene 1\n=======\n[Enter Friar Lawrence and County Paris.]\n\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nOn Thursday, sir?

I like it not.\n\nPARIS\nImmoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk of love,\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway,\nAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\nMay be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE, [aside]\nI would I knew not why it should be slowed.--\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\n\n[Enter Juliet.]\n\n\nPARIS\nHappily met, my lady and my wife.\n\nJULIET\nThat may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\n\nPARIS\nThat \"may be\" must be, love, on Thursday next.\n\nJULIET\nWhat must be shall be.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  That's a certain text.\n\nPARIS\nCome you to make confession to this father?\n\nJULIET\nTo answer that, I should confess to you.\n\nPARIS\nDo not deny to him that you love me.\n\nJULIET\nI will confess to you that I love him.\n\nPARIS\nSo will you, I am sure, that you love me.\n\nJULIET\nIf I do so, it will be of more price\nBeing spoke behind your back than to your face.\n\nPARIS\nPoor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.\n\nJULIET\nThe tears have got small victory by that,\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\n\nPARIS\nThou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\n\nJULIET\nThat is no slander, sir, which is a truth,\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\n\nPARIS\nThy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.\n\nJULIET\nIt may be so, for it is not mine own.--\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\nOr shall I come to you at evening Mass?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nMy leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.--\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\n\nPARIS\nGod shield I should disturb devotion!--\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.\t[He exits.]\n\nJULIET\nO, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,\nCome weep with me, past hope, past care, past help.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nO Juliet, I already know thy grief.\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\n\nJULIET\nTell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\nIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise,\nAnd with this knife I'll help it presently.\n[She shows him her knife.]\nGod joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's sealed,\nShall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\nTherefore out of thy long-experienced time\nGive me some present counsel, or, behold,\n'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the umpire, arbitrating that\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honor bring.\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die\nIf what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHold, daughter, I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris,\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop'st with death himself to 'scape from it;\nAnd if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.\n\nJULIET\nO, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of any tower,\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears,\nOr hide me nightly in a charnel house,\nO'ercovered quite with dead men's rattling bones,\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud\n(Things that to hear them told have made me\ntremble),\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstained wife to my sweet love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHold, then.

Therefore he that cannot lick his\nfingers goes not with me.\n\nCAPULET  Go, begone.\t[Servingman exits.]\nWe shall be much unfurnished for this time.--\nWhat, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?\n\nNURSE  Ay, forsooth.\n\nCAPULET\nWell, he may chance to do some good on her.\nA peevish self-willed harlotry it is.\n\n[Enter Juliet.]\n\n\nNURSE\nSee where she comes from shrift with merry look.\n\nCAPULET\nHow now, my headstrong, where have you been\ngadding?\n\nJULIET\nWhere I have learned me to repent the sin\nOf disobedient opposition\nTo you and your behests, and am enjoined\nBy holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here\t[Kneeling.]\nTo beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.\nHenceforward I am ever ruled by you.\n\nCAPULET\nSend for the County. Go tell him of this.\nI'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.\n\nJULIET\nI met the youthful lord at Lawrence' cell\nAnd gave him what becomed love I might,\nNot stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.\n\nCAPULET\nWhy, I am glad on 't. This is well. Stand up.\n[Juliet rises.]\nThis is as 't should be.--Let me see the County.\nAy, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.--\nNow, afore God, this reverend holy friar,\nAll our whole city is much bound to him.\n\nJULIET\nNurse, will you go with me into my closet\nTo help me sort such needful ornaments\nAs you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?\n\nLADY CAPULET\nNo, not till Thursday. There is time enough.\n\nCAPULET\nGo, nurse. Go with her. We'll to church tomorrow.\n[Juliet and the Nurse exit.]\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWe shall be short in our provision.\n'Tis now near night.\n\nCAPULET  Tush, I will stir about,\nAnd all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.\nGo thou to Juliet. Help to deck up her.\nI'll not to bed tonight. Let me alone.\nI'll play the housewife for this once.--What ho!--\nThey are all forth. Well, I will walk myself\nTo County Paris, to prepare up him\nAgainst tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light\nSince this same wayward girl is so reclaimed.\n[They exit.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Juliet and Nurse.]\n\n\nJULIET\nAy, those attires are best. But, gentle nurse,\nI pray thee leave me to myself tonight,\nFor I have need of many orisons\nTo move the heavens to smile upon my state,\nWhich, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.\n\n[Enter Lady Capulet.]\n\n\nLADY CAPULET\nWhat, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?\n\nJULIET\nNo, madam, we have culled such necessaries\nAs are behooveful for our state tomorrow.\nSo please you, let me now be left alone,\nAnd let the Nurse this night sit up with you,\nFor I am sure you have your hands full all\nIn this so sudden business.\n\nLADY CAPULET  Good night.\nGet thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.\n[Lady Capulet and the Nurse exit.]\n\nJULIET\nFarewell.--God knows when we shall meet again.\nI have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins\nThat almost freezes up the heat of life.\nI'll call them back again to comfort me.--\nNurse!--What should she do here?\nMy dismal scene I needs must act alone.\nCome, vial.\t[She takes out the vial.]\nWhat if this mixture do not work at all?\nShall I be married then tomorrow morning?\n[She takes out her knife\nand puts it down beside her.]\nNo, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.\nWhat if it be a poison which the Friar\nSubtly hath ministered to have me dead,\nLest in this marriage he should be dishonored\nBecause he married me before to Romeo?\nI fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,\nFor he hath still been tried a holy man.\nHow if, when I am laid into the tomb,\nI wake before the time that Romeo\nCome to redeem me? There's a fearful point.\nShall I not then be stifled in the vault,\nTo whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\nAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\nOr, if I live, is it not very like\nThe horrible conceit of death and night,\nTogether with the terror of the place--\nAs in a vault, an ancient receptacle\nWhere for this many hundred years the bones\nOf all my buried ancestors are packed;\nWhere bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\nLies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,\nAt some hours in the night spirits resort--\nAlack, alack, is it not like that I,\nSo early waking, what with loathsome smells,\nAnd shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\nThat living mortals, hearing them, run mad--\nO, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\nEnvironed with all these hideous fears,\nAnd madly play with my forefathers' joints,\nAnd pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,\nAnd, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,\nAs with a club, dash out my desp'rate brains?\nO look, methinks I see my cousin's ghost\nSeeking out Romeo that did spit his body\nUpon a rapier's point! Stay, Tybalt, stay!\nRomeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's drink. I drink to\nthee.\t[She drinks and falls upon her bed\nwithin the curtains.]\n\nScene 4\n=======\n[Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.]\n\n\nLADY CAPULET\nHold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.\n\nNURSE\nThey call for dates and quinces in the pastry.\n\n[Enter old Capulet.]\n\n\nCAPULET\nCome, stir, stir, stir!

Faith, you'll be sick tomorrow\nFor this night's watching.\n\nCAPULET\nNo, not a whit. What, I have watched ere now\nAll night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nAy, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,\nBut I will watch you from such watching now.\n[Lady Capulet and Nurse exit.]\n\nCAPULET\nA jealous hood, a jealous hood!\n\n[Enter three or four Servingmen with spits and logs\nand baskets.]\n\nNow fellow,\nWhat is there?\n\nFIRST SERVINGMAN\nThings for the cook, sir, but I know not what.\n\nCAPULET\nMake haste, make haste.\t[First Servingman exits.]\nSirrah, fetch drier logs.\nCall Peter. He will show thee where they are.\n\nSECOND SERVINGMAN\nI have a head, sir, that will find out logs\nAnd never trouble Peter for the matter.\n\nCAPULET\nMass, and well said. A merry whoreson, ha!\nThou shalt be loggerhead.\n[Second Servingman exits.]\nGood faith, 'tis day.\nThe County will be here with music straight,\n[Play music.]\nFor so he said he would. I hear him near.--\nNurse!--Wife! What ho!--What, nurse, I say!\n\n[Enter Nurse.]\n\nGo waken Juliet. Go and trim her up.\nI'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,\nMake haste. The bridegroom he is come already.\nMake haste, I say.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 5\n=======\n\nNURSE, [approaching the bed]\nMistress! What, mistress!

Why, bride!--\nWhat, not a word?--You take your pennyworths\nnow.\nSleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,\nThe County Paris hath set up his rest\nThat you shall rest but little.--God forgive me,\nMarry, and amen! How sound is she asleep!\nI needs must wake her.--Madam, madam, madam!\nAy, let the County take you in your bed,\nHe'll fright you up, i' faith.--Will it not be?\n[She opens the bed's curtains.]\nWhat, dressed, and in your clothes, and down\nagain?\nI must needs wake you.

Out, alas, she's cold.\nHer blood is settled, and her joints are stiff.\nLife and these lips have long been separated.\nDeath lies on her like an untimely frost\nUpon the sweetest flower of all the field.\n\nNURSE\nO lamentable day!\n\nLADY CAPULET  O woeful time!\n\nCAPULET\nDeath, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,\nTies up my tongue and will not let me speak.\n\n[Enter Friar Lawrence and the County Paris, with\nMusicians.]\n\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nCome, is the bride ready to go to church?\n\nCAPULET\nReady to go, but never to return.--\nO son, the night before thy wedding day\nHath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,\nFlower as she was, deflowered by him.\nDeath is my son-in-law; Death is my heir.\nMy daughter he hath wedded. I will die\nAnd leave him all.

My soul and not my child!\nDead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,\nAnd with my child my joys are buried.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nPeace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not\nIn these confusions. Heaven and yourself\nHad part in this fair maid. Now heaven hath all,\nAnd all the better is it for the maid.\nYour part in her you could not keep from death,\nBut heaven keeps his part in eternal life.\nThe most you sought was her promotion,\nFor 'twas your heaven she should be advanced;\nAnd weep you now, seeing she is advanced\nAbove the clouds, as high as heaven itself?\nO, in this love you love your child so ill\nThat you run mad, seeing that she is well.\nShe's not well married that lives married long,\nBut she's best married that dies married young.\nDry up your tears, and stick your rosemary\nOn this fair corse, and, as the custom is,\nAnd in her best array, bear her to church,\nFor though fond nature bids us all lament,\nYet nature's tears are reason's merriment.\n\nCAPULET\nAll things that we ordained festival\nTurn from their office to black funeral:\nOur instruments to melancholy bells,\nOur wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,\nOur solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,\nOur bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,\nAnd all things change them to the contrary.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nSir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,\nAnd go, Sir Paris. Everyone prepare\nTo follow this fair corse unto her grave.\nThe heavens do lour upon you for some ill.\nMove them no more by crossing their high will.\n[All but the Nurse and the Musicians exit.]\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN\nFaith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.\n\nNURSE\nHonest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,\nFor, well you know, this is a pitiful case.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN\nAy, by my troth, the case may be amended.\n[Nurse exits.]\n\n[Enter Peter.]\n\n\nPETER  Musicians, O musicians, \"Heart's ease,\"\n\"Heart's ease.\" O, an you will have me live, play\n\"Heart's ease.\"\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  Why \"Heart's ease?\"\n\nPETER  O musicians, because my heart itself plays \"My\nheart is full.\" O, play me some merry dump to\ncomfort me.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  Not a dump, we. 'Tis no time to play\nnow.\n\nPETER  You will not then?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  No.\n\nPETER  I will then give it you soundly.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  What will you give us?\n\nPETER  No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give\nyou the minstrel.\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  Then will I give you the\nserving-creature.\n\nPETER  Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on\nyour pate. I will carry no crochets. I'll re you, I'll fa\nyou. Do you note me?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  An you re us and fa us, you note us.\n\nSECOND MUSICIAN  Pray you, put up your dagger and\nput out your wit.\n\nPETER  Then have at you with my wit.

Why \"music with her silver\nsound\"? What say you, Simon Catling?\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  Marry, sir, because silver hath a\nsweet sound.\n\nPETER  Prates.--What say you, Hugh Rebeck?\n\nSECOND MUSICIAN  I say \"silver sound\" because musicians\nsound for silver.\n\nPETER  Prates too.--What say you, James Soundpost?\n\nTHIRD MUSICIAN  Faith, I know not what to say.\n\nPETER  O, I cry you mercy. You are the singer. I will say\nfor you. It is \"music with her silver sound\" because\nmusicians have no gold for sounding:\n[Sings.]\tThen music with her silver sound\n\tWith speedy help doth lend redress.\n[He exits.]\n\nFIRST MUSICIAN  What a pestilent knave is this same!\n\nSECOND MUSICIAN  Hang him, Jack.

Is my father well?\nHow doth my Juliet? That I ask again,\nFor nothing can be ill if she be well.\n\nBALTHASAR\nThen she is well and nothing can be ill.\nHer body sleeps in Capels' monument,\nAnd her immortal part with angels lives.\nI saw her laid low in her kindred's vault\nAnd presently took post to tell it you.\nO, pardon me for bringing these ill news,\nSince you did leave it for my office, sir.\n\nROMEO\nIs it e'en so?--Then I deny you, stars!--\nThou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper,\nAnd hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.\n\nBALTHASAR\nI do beseech you, sir, have patience.\nYour looks are pale and wild and do import\nSome misadventure.\n\nROMEO  Tush, thou art deceived.\nLeave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.\nHast thou no letters to me from the Friar?\n\nBALTHASAR\nNo, my good lord.\n\nROMEO  No matter. Get thee gone,\nAnd hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.\n[Balthasar exits.]\nWell, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.\nLet's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men.\nI do remember an apothecary\n(And hereabouts he dwells) which late I noted\nIn tattered weeds, with overwhelming brows,\nCulling of simples. Meager were his looks.\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones.\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\nAn alligator stuffed, and other skins\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves,\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\nWere thinly scattered to make up a show.\nNoting this penury, to myself I said\n\"An if a man did need a poison now,\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.\"\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\nBeing holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.--\nWhat ho, Apothecary!\n\n[Enter Apothecary.]\n\n\nAPOTHECARY  Who calls so loud?\n\nROMEO\nCome hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\n[He offers money.]\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins,\nThat the life-weary taker may fall dead,\nAnd that the trunk may be discharged of breath\nAs violently as hasty powder fired\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\n\nAPOTHECARY\nSuch mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law\nIs death to any he that utters them.\n\nROMEO\nArt thou so bare and full of wretchedness,\nAnd fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\nNeed and oppression starveth in thy eyes,\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world's law.\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich.\nThen be not poor, but break it, and take this.\n\nAPOTHECARY\nMy poverty, but not my will, consents.\n\nROMEO\nI pay thy poverty and not thy will.\n\nAPOTHECARY, [giving him the poison]\nPut this in any liquid thing you will\nAnd drink it off, and if you had the strength\nOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\n\nROMEO, [handing him the money]\nThere is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,\nDoing more murder in this loathsome world\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not\nsell.\nI sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\nFarewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.\n[Apothecary exits.]\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\nTo Juliet's grave, for there must I use thee.\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 2\n=======\n[Enter Friar John.]\n\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nHoly Franciscan friar, brother, ho!\n\n[Enter Friar Lawrence.]\n\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nThis same should be the voice of Friar John.--\nWelcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?\nOr, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nGoing to find a barefoot brother out,\nOne of our order, to associate me,\nHere in this city visiting the sick,\nAnd finding him, the searchers of the town,\nSuspecting that we both were in a house\nWhere the infectious pestilence did reign,\nSealed up the doors and would not let us forth,\nSo that my speed to Mantua there was stayed.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nWho bare my letter, then, to Romeo?\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nI could not send it--here it is again--\n[Returning the letter.]\nNor get a messenger to bring it thee,\nSo fearful were they of infection.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nUnhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,\nThe letter was not nice but full of charge,\nOf dear import, and the neglecting it\nMay do much danger. Friar John, go hence.\nGet me an iron crow and bring it straight\nUnto my cell.\n\nFRIAR JOHN\nBrother, I'll go and bring it thee.\t[He exits.]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nNow must I to the monument alone.\nWithin this three hours will fair Juliet wake.\nShe will beshrew me much that Romeo\nHath had no notice of these accidents.\nBut I will write again to Mantua,\nAnd keep her at my cell till Romeo come.\nPoor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!\n[He exits.]\n\nScene 3\n=======\n[Enter Paris and his Page.]\n\n\nPARIS\nGive me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.\nYet put it out, for I would not be seen.\nUnder yond yew trees lay thee all along,\nHolding thy ear close to the hollow ground.\nSo shall no foot upon the churchyard tread\n(Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)\nBut thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me\nAs signal that thou hearest something approach.\nGive me those flowers. Do as I bid thee. Go.\n\nPAGE, [aside]\nI am almost afraid to stand alone\nHere in the churchyard. Yet I will adventure.\n[He moves away from Paris.]\n\nPARIS, [scattering flowers]\nSweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew\n(O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!)\nWhich with sweet water nightly I will dew,\nOr, wanting that, with tears distilled by moans.\nThe obsequies that I for thee will keep\nNightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.\n[Page whistles.]\nThe boy gives warning something doth approach.\nWhat cursed foot wanders this way tonight,\nTo cross my obsequies and true love's rite?\nWhat, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.\n[He steps aside.]\n\n[Enter Romeo and Balthasar.]\n\n\nROMEO\nGive me that mattock and the wrenching iron.\nHold, take this letter. Early in the morning\nSee thou deliver it to my lord and father.\nGive me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,\nWhate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof\nAnd do not interrupt me in my course.\nWhy I descend into this bed of death\nIs partly to behold my lady's face,\nBut chiefly to take thence from her dead finger\nA precious ring, a ring that I must use\nIn dear employment. Therefore hence, begone.\nBut, if thou, jealous, dost return to pry\nIn what I farther shall intend to do,\nBy heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint\nAnd strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.\nThe time and my intents are savage-wild,\nMore fierce and more inexorable far\nThan empty tigers or the roaring sea.\n\nBALTHASAR\nI will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\n\nROMEO\nSo shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.\n[Giving money.]\nLive and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.\n\nBALTHASAR, [aside]\nFor all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.\nHis looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.\n[He steps aside.]\n\nROMEO, [beginning to force open the tomb]\nThou detestable maw, thou womb of death,\nGorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,\nThus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,\nAnd in despite I'll cram thee with more food.\n\nPARIS\nThis is that banished haughty Montague\nThat murdered my love's cousin, with which grief\nIt is supposed the fair creature died,\nAnd here is come to do some villainous shame\nTo the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.\n[Stepping forward.]\nStop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague.\nCan vengeance be pursued further than death?\nCondemned villain, I do apprehend thee.\nObey and go with me, for thou must die.\n\nROMEO\nI must indeed, and therefore came I hither.\nGood gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.\nFly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone.\nLet them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,\nPut not another sin upon my head\nBy urging me to fury. O, begone!\nBy heaven, I love thee better than myself,\nFor I come hither armed against myself.\nStay not, begone, live, and hereafter say\nA madman's mercy bid thee run away.\n\nPARIS\nI do defy thy commination\nAnd apprehend thee for a felon here.\n\nROMEO\nWilt thou provoke me?

I think\nHe told me Paris should have married Juliet.\nSaid he not so? Or did I dream it so?\nOr am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,\nTo think it was so?--O, give me thy hand,\nOne writ with me in sour misfortune's book!\nI'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.--\n[He opens the tomb.]\nA grave? O, no. A lantern, slaughtered youth,\nFor here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes\nThis vault a feasting presence full of light.--\nDeath, lie thou there, by a dead man interred.\n[Laying Paris in the tomb.]\nHow oft when men are at the point of death\nHave they been merry, which their keepers call\nA light'ning before death! O, how may I\nCall this a light'ning?--O my love, my wife,\nDeath, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,\nHath had no power yet upon thy beauty.\nThou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet\nIs crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,\nAnd death's pale flag is not advanced there.--\nTybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?\nO, what more favor can I do to thee\nThan with that hand that cut thy youth in twain\nTo sunder his that was thine enemy?\nForgive me, cousin.--Ah, dear Juliet,\nWhy art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe\nThat unsubstantial death is amorous,\nAnd that the lean abhorred monster keeps\nThee here in dark to be his paramour?\nFor fear of that I still will stay with thee\nAnd never from this palace of dim night\nDepart again. Here, here will I remain\nWith worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here\nWill I set up my everlasting rest\nAnd shake the yoke of inauspicious stars\nFrom this world-wearied flesh! Eyes, look your last.\nArms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O, you\nThe doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\nA dateless bargain to engrossing death.\n[Kissing Juliet.]\nCome, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!\nThou desperate pilot, now at once run on\nThe dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!\nHere's to my love. [Drinking.] O true apothecary,\nThy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.\n[He dies.]\n\n[Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.]\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nSaint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight\nHave my old feet stumbled at graves!--Who's there?\n\nBALTHASAR\nHere's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nBliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,\nWhat torch is yond that vainly lends his light\nTo grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,\nIt burneth in the Capels' monument.\n\nBALTHASAR\nIt doth so, holy sir, and there's my master,\nOne that you love.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE  Who is it?\n\nBALTHASAR  Romeo.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nHow long hath he been there?\n\nBALTHASAR  Full half an hour.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nGo with me to the vault.\n\nBALTHASAR  I dare not, sir.\nMy master knows not but I am gone hence,\nAnd fearfully did menace me with death\nIf I did stay to look on his intents.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nStay, then. I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.\nO, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.\n\nBALTHASAR\nAs I did sleep under this yew tree here,\nI dreamt my master and another fought,\nAnd that my master slew him.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE, [moving toward the tomb]\nRomeo!--\nAlack, alack, what blood is this which stains\nThe stony entrance of this sepulcher?\nWhat mean these masterless and gory swords\nTo lie discolored by this place of peace?\nRomeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?\nAnd steeped in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour\nIs guilty of this lamentable chance!\nThe lady stirs.\n\nJULIET\nO comfortable friar, where is my lord?\nI do remember well where I should be,\nAnd there I am. Where is my Romeo?\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nI hear some noise.--Lady, come from that nest\nOf death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.\nA greater power than we can contradict\nHath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.\nThy husband in thy bosom there lies dead,\nAnd Paris, too. Come, I'll dispose of thee\nAmong a sisterhood of holy nuns.\nStay not to question, for the watch is coming.\nCome, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.\n\nJULIET\nGo, get thee hence, for I will not away.\n[He exits.]\nWhat's here? A cup closed in my true love's hand?\nPoison, I see, hath been his timeless end.--\nO churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop\nTo help me after! I will kiss thy lips.\nHaply some poison yet doth hang on them,\nTo make me die with a restorative.\t[She kisses him.]\nThy lips are warm!\n\n[Enter Paris's Page and Watch.]\n\n\nFIRST WATCH  Lead, boy. Which way?\n\nJULIET\nYea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O, happy dagger,\nThis is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.\n[She takes Romeo's dagger, stabs herself, and dies.]\n\nPAGE\nThis is the place, there where the torch doth burn.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nThe ground is bloody.--Search about the\nchurchyard.\nGo, some of you; whoe'er you find, attach.\n[Some watchmen exit.]\nPitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\nWho here hath lain this two days buried.--\nGo, tell the Prince. Run to the Capulets.\nRaise up the Montagues. Some others search.\n[Others exit.]\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\n\n[Enter Watchmen with Romeo's man Balthasar.]\n\n\nSECOND WATCH\nHere's Romeo's man. We found him in the\nchurchyard.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nHold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\n\n[Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.]\n\n\nTHIRD WATCH\nHere is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\nWe took this mattock and this spade from him\nAs he was coming from this churchyard's side.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nA great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.\n\n[Enter the Prince with Attendants.]\n\n\nPRINCE\nWhat misadventure is so early up\nThat calls our person from our morning rest?\n\n[Enter Capulet and Lady Capulet.]\n\n\nCAPULET\nWhat should it be that is so shrieked abroad?\n\nLADY CAPULET\nO, the people in the street cry \"Romeo,\"\nSome \"Juliet,\" and some \"Paris,\" and all run\nWith open outcry toward our monument.\n\nPRINCE\nWhat fear is this which startles in our ears?\n\nFIRST WATCH\nSovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,\nAnd Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,\nWarm and new killed.\n\nPRINCE\nSearch, seek, and know how this foul murder\ncomes.\n\nFIRST WATCH\nHere is a friar, and slaughtered Romeo's man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\nThese dead men's tombs.\n\nCAPULET\nO heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\nAnd it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom.\n\nLADY CAPULET\nO me, this sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulcher.\n\n[Enter Montague.]\n\n\nPRINCE\nCome, Montague, for thou art early up\nTo see thy son and heir now early down.\n\nMONTAGUE\nAlas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.\nGrief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath.\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\n\nPRINCE  Look, and thou shalt see.\n\nMONTAGUE, [seeing Romeo dead]\nO thou untaught! What manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\n\nPRINCE\nSeal up the mouth of outrage for awhile,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true\ndescent,\nAnd then will I be general of your woes\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.--\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nI am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\nDoth make against me, of this direful murder.\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\nMyself condemned and myself excused.\n\nPRINCE\nThen say at once what thou dost know in this.\n\nFRIAR LAWRENCE\nI will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.\nI married them, and their stol'n marriage day\nWas Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death\nBanished the new-made bridegroom from this city,\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetrothed and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me,\nAnd with wild looks bid me devise some mean\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her (so tutored by my art)\nA sleeping potion, which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrowed grave,\nBeing the time the potion's force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stayed by accident, and yesternight\nReturned my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred's vault,\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awakening, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes, and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience.\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know, and to the marriage\nHer nurse is privy. And if aught in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrificed some hour before his time\nUnto the rigor of severest law.\n\nPRINCE\nWe still have known thee for a holy man.--\nWhere's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?\n\nBALTHASAR\nI brought my master news of Juliet's death,\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father\nAnd threatened me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not and left him there.\n\nPRINCE\nGive me the letter. I will look on it.--\n[He takes Romeo's letter.]\nWhere is the County's page, that raised the\nwatch?--\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\n\nPAGE\nHe came with flowers to strew his lady's grave\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb,\nAnd by and by my master drew on him,\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\n\nPRINCE\nThis letter doth make good the Friar's words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death;\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies?--Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love,\nAnd I, for winking at your discords too,\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.\n\nCAPULET\nO brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\n\nMONTAGUE  But I can give thee more,\nFor I will ray her statue in pure gold,\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\n\nCAPULET\nAs rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie,\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity.\n\nPRINCE\nA glooming peace this morning with it brings.\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence to have more talk of these sad things.\nSome shall be pardoned, and some punished.\nFor never was a story of more woe\nThan this of Juliet and her Romeo.\n[All exit.]\n",

    "## TF-IDF Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Do some documents share distinctive vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. Several documents share distinctive vocabulary, particularly within the same genre and historical context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Within Tragedies:**\n",
    "- Roman plays share political vocabulary: *Julius Caesar*, *Antony and Cleopatra*, and *Coriolanus* all feature \"caesar,\" \"rome,\" and political titles (\"general,\" \"senate,\" \"capitol\")\n",
    "- English historical tragedies share geographic terms: *Hamlet* (\"norway,\" \"england\"), *Macbeth* (\"scotland\")\n",
    "- Domestic tragedies share family/relationship terms: *Othello* and *King Lear* include relationship markers (\"lieutenant,\" \"daughters,\" \"kent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Within Comedies:**\n",
    "- Romantic comedies share terms of courtship and social hierarchy: \"duke,\" \"count,\" \"prince\" appear across *Twelfth Night*, *As You Like It*, and *Much Ado About Nothing*\n",
    "- Italian comedies share geographic vocabulary: *The Merchant of Venice* (\"venice,\" \"ducats\"), *The Taming of the Shrew* (\"padua,\" \"signior\"), *The Comedy of Errors* (\"ducats,\" \"merchant\")\n",
    "- Pastoral/magical comedies: *A Midsummer Night's Dream* (\"fairy,\" \"wood,\" \"athens\") and *The Tempest* (\"island,\" \"monster\") share fantastical settings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Within Histories:**\n",
    "- All histories share aristocratic titles and English geography: \"duke,\" \"prince,\" \"york,\" \"john\"\n",
    "- The Henry IV plays are particularly close, both featuring \"falstaff,\" \"harry,\" \"prince,\" \"john,\" \"bardolph\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-genre patterns:**\n",
    "- Religious language appears inconsistently: \"friar\" (*Romeo and Juliet*, *Much Ado About Nothing*), \"gods\" (*King Lear*, *Antony and Cleopatra*, *Coriolanus*)\n",
    "- The interrogative \"does\" appears in multiple tragedies (*Hamlet*, *Macbeth*, *Twelfth Night*), possibly reflecting rhetorical questioning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Are distinctive terms topical, rhetorical, or technical?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Predominantly topical, with some rhetorical elements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinctive terms are mostly topical and character-driven, with some rhetorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topical (majority):**\n",
    "- **Character names dominate**: Nearly every play's distinctive vocabulary is character-driven (*Hamlet*: \"marcellus,\" \"ghost\"; *Othello*: \"roderigo,\" \"emilia\"; *Romeo and Juliet*: \"nurse,\" \"friar\"). This reflects Shakespeare's character-centric dramaturgy.\n",
    "- **Geographic specificity**: Place names establish setting (*Othello*: \"cyprus,\" \"venice\"; *Macbeth*: \"scotland\"; *Julius Caesar*: \"rome,\" \"philippi\")\n",
    "- **Plot-specific objects**: Key props appear as distinctive terms (*Othello*: \"handkerchief\"; *Macbeth*: \"daggers\"; *The Comedy of Errors*: \"chain,\" \"rope\"; *The Merchant of Venice*: \"bond\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rhetorical (limited):**\n",
    "- The appearance of \"does\" in *Hamlet*, *Macbeth*, and *Twelfth Night* may indicate rhetorical questioning patterns\n",
    "- *Hamlet*'s \"phrase\" and \"act\" suggest metatheatrical or philosophical discourse\n",
    "- Forms of address vary by genre: \"signior\" (Italian comedies), \"majesty\" (English histories/tragedies)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical:**\n",
    "- Military/political titles: \"lieutenant,\" \"general,\" \"capitol,\" \"senate\"\n",
    "- Legal/commercial terms: \"ducats,\" \"bond,\" \"merchant,\" \"clerk,\" \"judge\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight**: TF-IDF here primarily captures **what makes each play's world unique** (its cast of characters, setting, and central objects) rather than distinctive rhetorical strategies. This suggests Shakespeare's lexical variation operates more at the level of dramatic world-building than at stylistic differentiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Are there documents whose distinctiveness seems driven by noise or formatting?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is little evidence of formatting noise in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Character labels appear to have been successfully removed.\n",
    "- Stage directions do not dominate.\n",
    "- No artifacts like \"ACT\" or \"SCENE\" appear.\n",
    "- No OCR distortions or stray punctuation dominate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some generic verbs like *does* appear in multiple tragedies, but this is likely due to contextual emphasis rather than preprocessing error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the TF-IDF output appears clean and substantively meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for more refined lexical analysis, we might:\n",
    "1. Remove character names systematically\n",
    "2. Verify that stage directions are fully removed\n",
    "3. Standardize archaic verb forms (\"does\"/\"doth\")\n",
    "4. Consider lemmatization to group inflected forms"

Tragedies and comedies differ not only in vocabulary (what they discuss) but in syntax (how they construct arguments). However, problem plays and late romances resist clean classification, suggesting genre exists on a spectrum rather than as rigid categories. This analysis demonstrates that computational methods can illuminate both the coherence of traditional genre labels and their limitations.\""
